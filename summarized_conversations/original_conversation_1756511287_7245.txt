{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '# Working with Your Existing GitHub Repository\n\nGreat! I\'m glad to hear you\'ve already created a repository and connected to GitHub. This makes the process much simpler.\n\n## Next Steps for Adding Project Files\n\nNow that you have your repository set up, here\'s how you can add the files we\'ve created:\n\n### Option 1: Upload Files Through GitHub Web Interface\n\n1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.com\n2. Click the "Add file" button and select "Upload files"\n3. Drag and drop the files we\'ve created or use the file selector\n4. Add a commit message like "Add Legal Prejudice Analysis Project files"\n5. Click "Commit changes"\n\nThis works well for a small number of files but might be cumbersome for the entire project structure.\n\n### Option 2: Clone and Push Using Git (Recommended)\n\nThis is more efficient for adding all files at once:\n\n```bash\n# Clone your repository\ngit clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git\n\n# Copy all the files we\'ve created into the repository directory\n# (You can download them from this workspace first)\n\n# Add all files to git\ncd your-repository\ngit add .\n\n# Commit the changes\ngit commit -m "Add Legal Prejudice Analysis Project files"\n\n# Push to GitHub\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### Option 3: Download Files and Upload as ZIP\n\n1. Download all files from this workspace as a ZIP file\n2. Extract the ZIP file to your local machine\n3. Upload the files to your GitHub repository\n\n## Setting Up GitHub Pages (Optional)\n\nTo host your documentation on GitHub Pages:\n\n1. Go to your repository settings\n2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section\n3. Select the source branch (usually "main")\n4. Choose the "/docs" folder as the source\n5. Click "Save"\n\nYour documentation will be available at: `https://your-username.github.io/your-repository/`\n\n## Would You Like Me To:\n\n1.
