I\'ve also created the CNAME file in your docs directory, which is essential for your custom domain configuration.\n\n## Complete GitHub Pages Setup\n\nYour GitHub Pages setup is now properly configured with:\n\n1. ✅ All landing page files moved to the `docs` directory\n2. ✅ CNAME file created in the docs directory with your domain name\n\n## DNS Configuration for Your Domain\n\nTo complete the setup, you\'ll need to configure your domain\'s DNS settings:\n\n1. **Log in to your domain registrar** (where you purchased `legal-prejudice-analysis.com`)\n\n2. **Add these A records** pointing to GitHub Pages\' IP addresses:\n   ```\n   A    @    185.199.108.153\n   A    @    185.199.109.153\n   A    @    185.199.110.153\n   A    @    185.199.111.153\n   ```\n\n3. **Add a CNAME record** for the www subdomain:\n   ```\n   CNAME    www    yourusername.github.io.\n   ```\n   (Replace "yourusername" with your actual GitHub username)\n\n## Verify Your Setup\n\nAfter making these changes:\n\n1. **Commit and push all changes** to your GitHub repository\n2. **Wait for DNS propagation** (can take up to 48 hours, but often much faster)\n3. **Check your GitHub repository\'s Settings > Pages** section to verify:\n   - Your custom domain is set\n   - "Enforce HTTPS" is enabled (may take up to 24 hours after domain setup)\n\n## Testing Your Site\n\nOnce deployment is complete:\n1. Visit `https://legal-prejudice-analysis.com` to verify your site is live\n2. Test on multiple devices to ensure responsive design works properly\n3. Test any forms you\'ve implemented\n\nThe error should now be resolved, and your landing page should deploy successfully to your custom domain through GitHub Pages.\n\n<function_calls>\n<ask>\nI\'ve fixed the GitHub Pages deployment error by:\n\n1. Creating a `docs` directory in your repository\n2. Moving all landing page files to this directory\n3. Adding a CNAME file with your domain name\n\nTo complete the setup:\n\n1. Commit these changes to your GitHub repository:\n   ```\n   git add docs/\n   git commit -m "Move landing page to docs directory for GitHub Pages"\n   git push\n   ```\n\n2. Configure your domain\'s DNS settings with your registrar:\n   - Add A records pointing to GitHub Pages IP addresses\n   - Add a CNAME record for the www subdomain\n\n3. In your GitHub repository settings:\n   - Ensure GitHub Pages source is set to the main branch and /docs folder\n   - Verify your custom domain is configured\n\nThis should resolve the error and allow your landing page to deploy successfully to legal-prejudice-analysis.com.\n\nIs there anything else you\'d like me to help with regarding the deployment?\n</ask>\n</function_calls>', 'tool_calls': None}
