## Custom CMS Integration

If your case management system is not directly supported, you can build a custom integration:

### API Integration

1. **Authentication**: Obtain an API key from your Legal Prejudice Analysis account
2. **Case Synchronization**: Use the `/v1/cases` endpoint to create and update cases
3. **Assessment Creation**: Use the `/v1/assessments` endpoint to create assessments
4. **Results Retrieval**: Use the `/v1/results` endpoint to get assessment results
5. **Report Generation**: Use the `/v1/reports` endpoint to generate PDF reports

Example API request to create a case:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.legalprejudice.example.com/v1/cases" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "case_reference": "Smith v. Jones",
    "case_number": "CV-2025-12345",
    "court_name": "U.S. District Court, Northern District of California",
    "judge_name": "Hon. Robert Williams",
    "filing_date": "2025-07-15",
    "client_name": "Smith, John",
    "case_type": "Civil Rights",
    "external_id": "your-cms-case-id-123"
  }'
```

### Webhook Integration

1. **Register Webhook**: Create a webhook endpoint in your application
2. **Subscribe to Events**: Register your webhook URL with the Legal Prejudice Analysis API
3. **Process Events**: Handle incoming webhook payloads
4. **Update CMS**: Update your CMS based on the webhook data

Example webhook registration:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.legalprejudice.example.com/v1/webhooks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-cms-webhook-handler.example.com/prejudice-events",
    "events": ["assessment.created", "assessment.updated", "risk.changed"],
    "secret": "your-webhook-secret"
  }'
```

### File Import/Export

If API integration is not possible, you can use file-based integration:

1. **Export from CMS**: Export case data as CSV or JSON
2. **Import to Legal Prejudice**: Import the data using the bulk import tool
3. **Export Results**: Export assessment results as CSV or PDF
4. **Import to CMS**: Import the results back into your CMS
