This is a common issue that can have several causes. Let\'s troubleshoot this step by step:\n\n## Common Causes and Solutions for 404 Errors\n\n### 1. Check GitHub Pages Source Settings\n\nFirst, let\'s make sure GitHub Pages is correctly configured to use your docs directory:\n\n1. **Go to your GitHub repository**\n2. **Click on "Settings"**\n3. **Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" section**\n4. **Verify that:**\n   - Source is set to "main" branch\n   - Folder is set to "/docs"\n   - Custom domain is correctly set to "legal-prejudice-analysis.com"\n5. **If any settings are incorrect, update them and save**\n\n### 2. Verify Your Repository Structure\n\nMake sure your files are in the correct location:\n\n1. **Check that your index.html file is directly in the docs directory**\n   - It should be at `/docs/index.html`, not in a subdirectory\n2. **Verify that all necessary files (CSS, JS, images) are in the docs directory**\n3. **Make sure the CNAME file is in the docs directory**\n\n### 3. Check for Build Errors\n\nGitHub Pages might be failing to build your site:\n\n1. **Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository**\n2. **Look for any failed GitHub Pages build workflows**\n3. **Check the error messages if any builds failed**\n\n### 4. Verify DNS Configuration\n\nThe 404 error could be related to DNS issues:\n\n1. **Check that your DNS records are correctly set up in Namecheap**\n2. **Verify that the A records point to GitHub\'s IP addresses**\n3. **Make sure the CNAME record for www is correctly configured**\n4. **Use [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/) to verify your DNS propagation**\n\n### 5. Check for Jekyll Processing Issues\n\nGitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default, which can sometimes cause issues:\n\n1. **Create an empty file named `.nojekyll` in your docs directory**\n   - This tells GitHub not to process your site with Jekyll\n2. **Commit and push this file**\n\n### 6. Wait for DNS and GitHub Pages to Update\n\nSometimes it just takes time:\n\n1. **DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to fully propagate**\n2. **GitHub Pages can take up to 10 minutes to update after changes**\n3. **Try clearing your browser cache or using incognito mode**\n\n### 7. Check the Specific URL You\'re Using\n\nMake sure you\'re using the correct URL:\n\n1. **Try both https://legal-prejudice-analysis.com and https://www.legal-prejudice-analysis.com**\n2. **If only one works, make sure your DNS is configured correctly for both**\n\n## Next Steps to Fix the 404 Error\n\nLet\'s start with the most likely solutions:\n\n1. **Create a `.nojekyll` file in your docs directory**\n2. **Verify your index.html is directly in the docs directory**\n3. **Check GitHub Pages settings in your repository**\n\nWould you like me to provide more specific guidance on any of these steps?\n\n<function_calls>\n<ask>\n# Fixing 404 Error on GitHub Pages\n\nA 404 error usually means GitHub Pages can\'t find your content or isn\'t building your site correctly.
