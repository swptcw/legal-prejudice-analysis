{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '# Namecheap DNS Configuration - Host Field Issue\n\nI understand that Namecheap isn\'t letting you leave the host field blank. This is actually expected behavior - with Namecheap, you should use the `@` symbol for the apex domain, not a blank field.\n\n## Correct A Record Configuration for Namecheap\n\nFor the apex domain (legal-prejudice-analysis.com without www), you should:\n\n1. **Type**: A Record\n2. **Host**: @ (use the @ symbol, not blank)\n3. **Value**: 185.199.108.153\n4. **TTL**: Automatic\n\nIf Namecheap is not accepting the `@` symbol, there might be a different issue. Let\'s try these alternatives:\n\n## Alternative Approaches for Namecheap\n\n### Option 1: Check for Existing Records\n\nNamecheap might be preventing you from adding a new record because there\'s already an existing record for the apex domain:\n\n1. **Look for existing A records** or CNAME records with @ in the Host field\n2. **Delete these existing records** first\n3. **Then try adding your new A records**\n\n### Option 2: Use Namecheap\'s URL Redirect Record\n\nIf you continue to have issues with A records:\n\n1. **Add a URL Redirect Record**:\n   - Type: URL Redirect Record\n   - Host: @\n   - Value: http://www.legal-prejudice-analysis.com/\n   - Redirect Type: Permanent (301)\n   - Include path: yes\n\n2. **Then set up the www subdomain with CNAME**:\n   - Type: CNAME Record\n   - Host: www\n   - Value: yourusername.github.io. (with the trailing dot)\n\n### Option 3: Use Namecheap\'s Web Hosting Interface\n\nSometimes Namecheap has a different interface depending on if you have their hosting:\n\n1. **Check if you\'re in the "Advanced DNS" tab** (not the basic DNS tab)\n2. **Look for a section specifically for "Host Records" or "A Records"**\n3. **Try adding your A records there**\n\n## Screenshot Request\n\nIf you\'re still having trouble, it might help if you could share a screenshot of what you\'re seeing in the Namecheap interface. This would allow me to provide more specific guidance based on exactly what you\'re seeing.\n\n## Contact Namecheap Support\n\nIf none of these solutions work, Namecheap has good customer support that can help:\n\n1. **Use Namecheap\'s live chat support**\n2. **Explain that you need to add A records for GitHub Pages**\n3. **They can often add the records for you if there\'s an interface issue**\n\n<function_calls>\n<ask>\n# Namecheap DNS Configuration - Host Field Issue\n\nFor Namecheap, you should definitely use the @ symbol for the apex domain, not a blank field:\n\n1.
