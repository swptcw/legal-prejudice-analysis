Gershowitz.JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court. Section\\\\n455(a) of Title 28 of the United States Code requires a federal\\\\njudge to \\\\"disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his\\\\nimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.\\\\" This case presents\\\\nthe question whether required recusal under this provision is\\\\nsubject to the limitation that has come to be known as the\\\\n\\\\"extrajudicial source\\\\" doctrine.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n542IIn the 1991 trial at issue here, petitioners were charged with\\\\nwillful destruction of property of the United States in violation\\\\nof 18 U. S. C. \\\\u00a7 1361. The indictment alleged that they had\\\\ncommitted acts of vandalism, including the spilling of human blood\\\\non walls and various objects, at the Fort Benning Military\\\\nReservation. Before trial petitioners moved to disqualify the\\\\nDistrict Judge pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \\\\u00a7 455(a). The motion relied\\\\non events that had occurred during and immediately after an earlier\\\\ntrial, involving petitioner Bourgeois, before the same District\\\\nJudge.In the 1983 bench trial, Bourgeois, a Catholic priest of the\\\\nMaryknoll order, had been tried and convicted of various\\\\nmisdemeanors committed during a protest action, also on the federal\\\\nenclave of Fort Benning. Petitioners claimed that recusal was\\\\nrequired in the present case because the judge had displayed\\\\n\\\\"impatience, disregard for the defense and animosity\\\\" toward\\\\nBourgeois, Bourgeois\\\' codefendants, and their beliefs. The alleged\\\\nevidence of that included the following words and acts by the\\\\njudge: stating at the outset of the trial that its purpose was to\\\\ntry a criminal case and not to provide a political forum; observing\\\\nafter Bourgeois\\\' opening statement (which described the purpose of\\\\nhis protest) that the statement ought to have been directed toward\\\\nthe anticipated evidentiary showing; limiting defense counsel\\\'s\\\\ncrossexamination; questioning witnesses; periodically cautioning\\\\ndefense counsel to confine his questions to issues material to\\\\ntrial; similarly admonishing witnesses to keep answers responsive\\\\nto actual questions directed to material issues; admonishing\\\\nBourgeois that closing argument was not a time for \\\\"making a\\\\nspeech\\\\" in a \\\\"political forum\\\\"; and giving Bourgeois what\\\\npetitioners considered to be an excessive sentence. The final\\\\nasserted ground for disqualificationand the one that counsel for\\\\npetitioners described at oral argument as the most serious-was the\\\\njudge\\\'s interruption of the closing argument of one of Bourgeois\\\'\\\\ncodefendants,\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n543instructing him to cease the introduction of new facts, and to\\\\nrestrict himself to discussion of evidence already presented.The District Judge denied petitioners\\\' disqualification motion,\\\\nstating that matters arising from judicial proceedings were not a\\\\nproper basis for recusal. At the outset of the trial, Bourgeois\\\'\\\\ncounsel informed the judge that he intended to focus his defense on\\\\nthe political motivation for petitioners\\\' actions, which was to\\\\nprotest United States Government involvement in EI Salvador. The\\\\njudge said that he would allow petitioners to state their political\\\\npurposes in opening argument and to testify about them as well, but\\\\nthat he would not allow long speeches or discussions concerning\\\\nGovernment policy. When, in the course of opening argument,\\\\nBourgeois\\\' counsel began to explain the circumstances surrounding\\\\ncertain events in EI Salvador, the prosecutor objected, and the\\\\njudge stated that he would not allow discussion about events in EI\\\\nSalvador. He then instructed defense counsel to limit his remarks\\\\nto what he expected the evidence to show. At the close of the\\\\nprosecution\\\'s case, Bourgeois renewed his disqualification motion,\\\\nadding as grounds for it the District Judge\\\'s \\\\"admonishing [him] in\\\\nfront of the jury\\\\" regarding the opening statement, and the\\\\nDistrict Judge\\\'s unspecified \\\\"admonishing [of] others,\\\\" in\\\\nparticular Bourgeois\\\' two *pro se* codefendants. The motion\\\\nwas again denied. Petitioners were convicted of the offense\\\\ncharged.Petitioners appealed, claiming that the District Judge violated\\\\n28 U. S. C. \\\\u00a7 455(a) in refusing to recuse himself. The Eleventh\\\\nCircuit affirmed the convictions, agreeing with the District Court\\\\nthat \\\\"matters arising out of the course of judicial proceedings are\\\\nnot a proper basis for recusal.\\\\" [973 F.2d\\\\n910](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/973/910/) (1992). We granted certiorari. 508 U. S. 939 (1993).IIRequired judicial recusal for bias did not exist in England at\\\\nthe time of Blackstone. 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n544\\\\\\\\*361. Since 1792, federal statutes have compelled district\\\\njudges to recuse themselves when they have an interest in the suit,\\\\nor have been counsel to a party. See Act of May 8, 1792, ch. 36, \\\\u00a7\\\\n11, 1 Stat. 278. In 1821, the basis of recusal was expanded to\\\\ninclude all judicial relationship or connection with a party that\\\\nwould in the judge\\\'s opinion make it improper to sit. Act of Mar.\\\\n3, 1821, ch. 51, 3 Stat. 643. Not until 1911, however, was a\\\\nprovision enacted requiring district-judge recusal for bias *in\\\\ngeneral.* In its current form, codified at 28 U. S. C. \\\\u00a7 144,\\\\nthat provision reads as follows:\\\\n> \\\\"Whenever a party to any proceeding in a district court makes\\\\n> and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the judge before\\\\n> whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either\\\\n> against him or in favor of any adverse party, such judge shall\\\\n> proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be assigned to\\\\n> hear such proceeding.\\\\n\\\\n> \\\\"The affidavit shall state the facts and the reasons for the\\\\n> belief that bias or prejudice exists, and shall be filed not less\\\\n> than ten days before the beginning of the term at which the\\\\n> proceeding is to be heard, or good cause shall be shown for failure\\\\n> to file it within such time. A party may file only one such\\\\n> affidavit in any case. It shall be accompanied by a certificate of\\\\n> counsel of record stating that it is made in good faith.\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nUnder \\\\u00a7 144 and its predecessor, there came to be generally\\\\napplied in the courts of appeals a doctrine, more standard in its\\\\nformulation than clear in its application, requiring-to take its\\\\nclassic formulation found in an oft-cited opinion by Justice\\\\nDouglas for this Court-that \\\\"[t]he alleged bias and prejudice to be\\\\ndisqualifying [under \\\\u00a7 144] must stem from an extrajudicial\\\\nsource.\\\\" *United States* v. *Grinnell Corp.,* [384 U. S. 563](/cases/federal/us/384/563/), 583\\\\n(1966). We say that the doctrine was less than entirely clear in\\\\nits application for\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n545several reasons. First, *Grinnell* (the only opinion of\\\\nours to recite the doctrine) clearly meant by \\\\"extrajudicial\\\\nsource\\\\" a source outside the judicial proceeding at hand-which\\\\nwould include as extrajudicial sources earlier judicial proceedings\\\\nconducted by the same judge (as are at issue here).! Yet many,\\\\nperhaps most, Courts of Appeals considered knowledge (and the\\\\nresulting attitudes) that a judge properly acquired in an earlier\\\\nproceeding *not* to be \\\\"extrajudicial.\\\\" See, *e. g.,\\\\nLyons* v. *United States,* [325 F.2d\\\\n370](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/325/370/), 376 (CA9), cert. denied, 377 U. S. 969 (1964);\\\\n*Craven* v. *United States,* 22 F.2d 605, 607-608 (CA1\\\\n1927). Secondly, the doctrine was often quoted as justifying the\\\\nrefusal to consider trial *rulings* as the basis for \\\\u00a7 144\\\\nrecusal. See, *e. g., Toth* v. *Trans World Airlines,\\\\nInc.,* [862 F.2d\\\\n1381](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/862/1381/), 1387-1388 (CA9 1988); *Liberty Lobby, Inc.* v.\\\\n*Dow Jones* & *Co.,* [838 F.2d\\\\n1287](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/838/1287/), 1301 (CADC), cert. denied, 488 U. S. 825 (1988). But\\\\ntrial *rulings* have a judicial *expression* rather than\\\\na judicial *source.* They may well be based upon extrajudicial\\\\nknowledge or motives. Cf. *In re International Business Machines\\\\nCorp.,* [618 F.2d\\\\n923](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/618/923/), 928, n. 6 (CA2 1980). And finally, even in cases in which\\\\nthe \\\\"source\\\\" of the bias or prejudice was clearly the proceedings\\\\nthemselves (for example, testimony introduced or an event occurring\\\\nat trial which produced unsuppressible judicial animosity), the\\\\nsupposed doctrine would not necessarily be applied. See, *e. g.,\\\\nDavis* v. *Board of School Comm\\\'rs of Mobile County,*\\\\n[517 F.2d\\\\n1044](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/517/1044/), 1051 (CA5 1975) (doctrine has \\\\"pervasive bias\\\\"\\\\nexception), cert. denied, 425 U. S. 944 (1976);1 That is clear when the language from *Grinnell* excerpted\\\\nabove is expanded to include its entire context: \\\\"The alleged bias\\\\nand prejudice to be disqualifying must stem from an extrajudicial\\\\nsource and result in an opinion on the merits on some basis other\\\\nthan what the judge learned from his participation in the case.\\\\n*Berger* v. *United States,* [255 U. S. 22](/cases/federal/us/255/22/), 31. Any\\\\nadverse attitudes that [the district judge in the present case]\\\\nevinced toward the defendants were based on his study of the\\\\ndepositions and briefs which the parties had requested him to\\\\nmake.\\\\" 384 U. S., at 583. The cited case, *Berger,* had found\\\\nrecusal required on the basis of judicial remarks made in an\\\\nearlier proceeding.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n546*Rice* v. *McKenzie,* [581 F.2d\\\\n1114](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/581/1114/), 1118 (CA4 1978) (doctrine \\\\"has always had\\\\nlimitations\\\\").Whatever the precise contours of the \\\\"extrajudicial source\\\\"\\\\ndoctrine (a subject to which we will revert shortly), it is the\\\\ncontention of petitioners that the doctrine has no application to \\\\u00a7\\\\n455(a). Most Courts of Appeals to consider the matter have rejected\\\\nthis contention, see *United States* v. *Barry,*\\\\n[961 F.2d\\\\n260](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/961/260/), 263 (CADC 1992); *United States* v. *Sammons,*\\\\n[918 F.2d\\\\n592](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/918/592/),599 (CA6 1990); *McWhorter* v. *Birmingham,*\\\\n[906 F.2d\\\\n674](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/906/674/), 678 (CAll 1990); *United States* v. *Mitchell,*\\\\n[886 F.2d\\\\n667](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/886/667/), 671 (CA4 1989); *United States* v. *Merkt,*\\\\n[794 F.2d\\\\n950](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/794/950/), 960 (CA5 1986), cert. denied, 480 U.

To understand the arguments pro and con it is necessary to\\\\nappreciate the major changes in prior law effected by the revision\\\\nof \\\\u00a7 455 in 1974.Before 1974, \\\\u00a7 455 was nothing more than the then-current\\\\nversion of the 1821 prohibition against a judge\\\'s presiding who has\\\\nan interest in the case or a relationship to a party. It read,\\\\nquite simply:\\\\n> \\\\"Any justice or judge of the United States shall disqualify\\\\n> himself in any case in which he has a substantial interest, has\\\\n> been of counsel, is or has been a material witness, or is so\\\\n> related to or connected with any party or his attorney as to render\\\\n> it improper, in his opinion, for him to sit on the trial, appeal,\\\\n> or other proceeding therein.\\\\" 28 U. S. C. \\\\u00a7 455 (1970 ed.).\\\\n\\\\nThe 1974 revision made massive changes, so that \\\\u00a7455 now reads\\\\nas follows:\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n547\\\\"(a) Any justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States\\\\nshall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his\\\\nimpartiality might reasonably be questioned. \\\\"(b) He shall also\\\\ndisqualify himself in the following circumstances:\\\\"(1) Where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a\\\\nparty, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts\\\\nconcerning the proceeding;\\\\"(2) Where in private practice he served as lawyer in the matter\\\\nin controversy, or a lawyer with whom he previously practiced law\\\\nserved during such association as a lawyer concerning the matter,\\\\nor the judge or such lawyer has been a material witness concerning\\\\nit;\\\\"(3) Where he has served in governmental employment and in such\\\\ncapacity participated as counsel, adviser or material witness\\\\nconcerning the proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the\\\\nmerits of the particular case in controversy;\\\\"(4) He knows that he, individually or as a fiduciary, or his\\\\nspouse or minor child residing in his household, has a financial\\\\ninterest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the\\\\nproceeding, or any other interest that could be substantially\\\\naffected by the outcome of the proceeding;\\\\"(5) He or his spouse, or a person within the third degree of\\\\nrelationship to either of them, or the spouse of such a person:\\\\"(i) Is a party to the proceeding, or an officer, director, or\\\\ntrustee of a party;\\\\"(ii) Is acting as a lawyer in the proceeding;\\\\"(iii) Is known by the judge to have an interest that could be\\\\nsubstantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding;\\\\"(iv) Is to the judge\\\'s knowledge likely to be a material\\\\nwitness in the proceeding.\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n548Almost all of the revision (paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(5))\\\\nmerely rendered objective and spelled out in detail the \\\\"interest\\\\"\\\\nand \\\\"relationship\\\\" grounds of recusal that had previously been\\\\ncovered by \\\\u00a7 455. But the other two paragraphs of the revision\\\\nbrought into \\\\u00a7 455 elements of general \\\\"bias and prejudice\\\\" recusal\\\\nthat had previously been addressed only by \\\\u00a7 144. Specifically,\\\\nparagraph (b)(l) entirely duplicated the grounds of recusal set\\\\nforth in \\\\u00a7 144 (\\\\"bias or prejudice\\\\"), but (1) made them applicable\\\\nto *all* justices, judges, and magistrates (and not just\\\\ndistrict judges), and (2) placed the obligation to identify the\\\\nexistence of those grounds upon the judge himself, rather than\\\\nrequiring recusal only in response to a party affidavit.Subsection (a), the provision at issue here, was an entirely new\\\\n\\\\"catchall\\\\" recusal provision, covering both \\\\"interest or\\\\nrelationship\\\\" and \\\\"bias or prejudice\\\\" grounds, see *Liljeberg*\\\\nv. *Health Services Acquisition Corp.,* [486 U. S. 847](/cases/federal/us/486/847/) (1988)but\\\\nrequiring them *all* to be evaluated on an *objective*\\\\nbasis, so that what matters is not the reality of bias or prejudice\\\\nbut its appearance. Quite simply and quite universally, recusal was\\\\nrequired whenever \\\\"impartiality might reasonably be\\\\nquestioned.\\\\"What effect these changes had upon the \\\\"extrajudicial source\\\\"\\\\ndoctrine-whether they in effect render it obsolete, of continuing\\\\nrelevance only to \\\\u00a7 144, which seems to be properly invocable only\\\\nwhen \\\\u00a7 455(a) can be invoked anywaydepends upon what the basis for\\\\nthat doctrine was. Petitioners suggest that it consisted of the\\\\nlimitation of \\\\u00a7 144 to *\\\\"personal* bias or prejudice,\\\\" bias or\\\\nprejudice officially acquired being different from \\\\"personal\\\\" bias\\\\nor prejudice. And, petitioners point out, while \\\\u00a7 455(b)(1) retains\\\\nthe phrase \\\\"personal bias or prejudice,\\\\" \\\\u00a7 455(a) proscribes all\\\\npartiality, not merely the \\\\"personal\\\\" sort.It is true that a number of Courts of Appeals have relied upon\\\\nthe word \\\\"personal\\\\" in restricting \\\\u00a7 144 to extrajudicial sources,\\\\nsee, *e. g., Craven* v. *United States,* 22 F.2d 605,\\\\n607-\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n549608 (GAl 1927); *Ferrari* v. *United States,* 169 F.2d\\\\n353, 355 (GA9 1948). And several cases have cited the absence of\\\\nthat word as a reason for excluding that restriction from \\\\u00a7 455(a),\\\\nsee *United States* v. *Coven, supra,* at 168, cert.\\\\ndenied, 456 U. S. 916 (1982); *Panzardi-Alvarez* v. *United\\\\nStates,* [879 F.2d\\\\n975](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/879/975/), 983-984, and n. 6 (GAl), cert. denied, 493 U. S. 1082\\\\n(1989). It seems to us, however, that that mistakes the basis for\\\\nthe \\\\"extrajudicial source\\\\" doctrine. Petitioners\\\' suggestion that\\\\nwe relied upon the word \\\\"personal\\\\" in our *Grinnell* opinion\\\\nis simply in error. The only reason *Grinnell* gave for its\\\\n\\\\"extrajudicial source\\\\" holding was citation of our opinion almost\\\\nhalf a century earlier in *Berger* v. *United States,*\\\\n[255 U. S. 22](/cases/federal/us/255/22/)\\\\n(1921). But that case, and the case which it in turn cited, *Ex\\\\nparte American Steel Barrel* *Co.,* [230 U. S. 35](/cases/federal/us/230/35/) (1913),\\\\nrelied not upon the word \\\\"personal\\\\" in \\\\u00a7 144, but upon its\\\\nprovision requiring the recusal affidavit to be filed 10 days\\\\nbefore the beginning of the court term. That requirement was the\\\\nreason we found it obvious in *Berger* that the affidavit\\\\n\\\\"must be based upon facts antedating the trial, not those occurring\\\\nduring the trial,\\\\" 255 U. S., at 34; and the reason we said in\\\\n*American Steel Barrel* that the recusal statute \\\\"was never\\\\nintended to enable a discontented litigant to oust a judge because\\\\nof adverse rulings made, ... but to prevent his future action in\\\\nthe pending cause,\\\\" 230 U. S., at 44.In our view, the proper (though unexpressed) rationale for\\\\n*Grinnell,* and the basis of the modern \\\\"extrajudicial source\\\\"\\\\ndoctrine, is not the statutory term \\\\"personal\\\\"-for several reasons.\\\\nFirst and foremost, that explanation is simply not the semantic\\\\nsuccess it pretends to be. Bias and prejudice seem to us not\\\\ndivided into the \\\\"personal\\\\" kind, which is offensive, and the\\\\nofficial kind, which is perfectly all right. As generally used,\\\\nthese are pejorative terms, describing dispositions that are\\\\n*never* appropriate. It is common to speak of \\\\"personal bias\\\\"\\\\nor \\\\"personal prejudice\\\\" without meaning the adjective to do\\\\nanything except emphasize the\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n550idiosyncratic nature of bias and prejudice, and certainly\\\\nwithout implying that there is some other \\\\"nonpersonal,\\\\" benign\\\\ncategory of those mental states. In a similar vein, one speaks of\\\\nan individual\\\'s \\\\"personal preference,\\\\" without implying that he\\\\ncould also have a \\\\"nonpersonal preference.\\\\" Secondly, interpreting\\\\nthe term \\\\"personal\\\\" to create a complete dichotomy between\\\\ncourt-acquired and extrinsically acquired bias produces results so\\\\nintolerable as to be absurd. Imagine, for example, a lengthy trial\\\\nin which the presiding judge for the first time learns of an\\\\nobscure religious sect, and acquires a passionate hatred for all\\\\nits adherents. This would be \\\\"official\\\\" rather than \\\\"personal\\\\"\\\\nbias, and would provide no basis for the judge\\\'s recusing\\\\nhimself.It seems to us that the origin of the \\\\"extrajudicial source\\\\"\\\\ndoctrine, and the key to understanding its flexible scope (or the\\\\nso-called \\\\"exceptions\\\\" to it), is simply the pejorative connotation\\\\nof the words \\\\"bias or prejudice.\\\\" Not *all* unfavorable\\\\ndisposition towards an individual (or his case) is properly\\\\ndescribed by those terms. One would not say, for example, that\\\\nworld opinion is biased or prejudiced against Adolf Hitler. The\\\\nwords connote a favorable or unfavorable disposition or opinion\\\\nthat is somehow *wrongful* or *inappropriate,* either\\\\nbecause it is undeserved, or because it rests upon knowledge that\\\\nthe subject ought not to possess (for example, a criminal juror who\\\\nhas been biased or prejudiced by receipt of inadmissible evidence\\\\nconcerning the defendant\\\'s prior criminal activities), or because\\\\nit is excessive in degree (for example, a criminal juror who is so\\\\ninflamed by properly admitted evidence of a defendant\\\'s prior\\\\ncriminal activities that he will vote guilty regardless of the\\\\nfacts). The \\\\"extrajudicial source\\\\" doctrine is one application of\\\\nthis pejorativeness requirement to the terms \\\\"bias\\\\" and \\\\"prejudice\\\\"\\\\nas they are used in \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 144 and 455(b)(1) with specific reference to\\\\nthe work of judges.The judge who presides at a trial may, upon completion of the\\\\nevidence, be exceedingly ill disposed towards the defend-\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n551ant, who has been shown to be a thoroughly reprehensible person.\\\\nBut the judge is not thereby recusable for bias or prejudice, since\\\\nhis knowledge and the opinion it produced were properly and\\\\nnecessarily acquired in the course of the proceedings, and are\\\\nindeed sometimes (as in a bench trial) necessary to completion of\\\\nthe judge\\\'s task. As Judge Jerome Frank pithily put it:\\\\n\\\\"Impartiality is not gullibility. Disinterestedness does not mean\\\\nchild-like innocence. If the judge did not form judgments of the\\\\nactors in those court-house dramas called trials, he could never\\\\nrender decisions.\\\\" *In re* *J.* *P. Linahan, Inc.,*\\\\n138 F.2d 650, 654 (CA2 1943). Also not subject to deprecatory\\\\ncharacterization as \\\\"bias\\\\" or \\\\"prejudice\\\\" are opinions held by\\\\njudges as a result of what they learned in earlier proceedings. It\\\\nhas long been regarded as normal and proper for a judge to sit in\\\\nthe same case upon its remand, and to sit in successive trials\\\\ninvolving the same defendant.It is wrong in theory, though it may not be too far off the mark\\\\nas a practical matter, to suggest, as many opinions have, that\\\\n\\\\"extrajudicial source\\\\" is the *only* basis for establishing\\\\ndisqualifying bias or prejudice. It is the only *common*\\\\nbasis, but not the exclusive one, since it is not the\\\\n*exclusive* reason a predisposition can be wrongful or\\\\ninappropriate. A favorable or unfavorable predisposition can also\\\\ndeserve to be characterized as \\\\"bias\\\\" or \\\\"prejudice\\\\" because, even\\\\nthough it springs from the facts adduced or the events occurring at\\\\ntrial, it is so extreme as to display clear inability to render\\\\nfair judgment. (That explains what some courts have called the\\\\n\\\\"pervasive bias\\\\" exception to the \\\\"extrajudicial source\\\\" doctrine.\\\\nSee, *e.* *g.,* *Davis* v. *Board of School\\\\nComm\\\'rs of Mobile County,* [517 F.2d\\\\n1044](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/517/1044/), 1051 (CA5 1975), cert. denied, 425 U. S. 944 (1976).)With this understanding of the \\\\"extrajudicial source\\\\" limitation\\\\nin \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 144 and 455(b)(1), we turn to the question whether it appears\\\\nin \\\\u00a7 455(a) as well. Petitioners\\\' argument for the negative based\\\\nupon the mere absence of the\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n552word \\\\"personal\\\\" is, for the reasons described above, not\\\\npersuasive. Petitioners also rely upon the categorical nature of \\\\u00a7\\\\n455\\\'s language: Recusal is required *whenever* there exists a\\\\ngenuine question concerning a judge\\\'s impartiality, and not merely\\\\nwhen the question arises from an extrajudicial source. A similar\\\\n\\\\"plain-language\\\\" argument could be made, however, with regard to \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7\\\\n144 and 455(b)(1): They apply *whenever* bias or prejudice\\\\nexists, and not merely when it derives from an extrajudicial\\\\nsource. As we have described, the latter argument is invalid\\\\nbecause the pejorative connotation of the terms \\\\"bias\\\\" and\\\\n\\\\"prejudice\\\\" demands that they be applied only to judicial\\\\npredispositions that go beyond what is normal and acceptable. We\\\\nthink there is an equivalent pejorative connotation, with\\\\nequivalent consequences, to the term \\\\"partiality.\\\\" See American\\\\nHeritage Dictionary 1319 (3d ed. 1992) (\\\\"partiality\\\\" defined as\\\\n\\\\"[f]avorable prejudice or bias\\\\"). A prospective juror in an\\\\ninsurance-claim case may be stricken as partial if he always votes\\\\nfor insurance companies; but not if he always votes for the party\\\\nwhom the terms of the contract support. \\\\"Partiality\\\\" does not refer\\\\nto all favoritism, but only to such as is, for some reason,\\\\nwrongful or inappropriate. Impartiality is not gullibility.\\\\nMoreover, even if the pejorative connotation of \\\\"partiality\\\\" were\\\\nnot enough to import the \\\\"extrajudicial source\\\\" doctrine into \\\\u00a7\\\\n455(a), the \\\\"reasonableness\\\\" limitation (recusal is required only\\\\nif the judge\\\'s impartiality \\\\"might *reasonably* be\\\\nquestioned\\\\") would have the same effect. To demand the sort of\\\\n\\\\"child-like innocence\\\\" that elimination of the \\\\"extrajudicial\\\\nsource\\\\" limitation would require is not reasonable.Declining to find in the language of \\\\u00a7 455(a) a limitation which\\\\n(petitioners acknowledge) *is* contained in the language of \\\\u00a7\\\\n455(b)(1) would cause the statute, in a significant sense, to\\\\ncontradict itself. As we have described, \\\\u00a7 455(a) expands the\\\\nprotection of \\\\u00a7 455(b), but duplicates some of its protection as\\\\nwell-not only with regard to bias and prejudice but also with\\\\nregard to interest and relationship. Within the\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n553area of overlap, it is unreasonable to interpret \\\\u00a7 455(a)\\\\n(unless the language *requires* it) as implicitly eliminating\\\\na limitation explicitly set forth in \\\\u00a7 455(b). It would obviously\\\\nbe wrong, for example, to hold that \\\\"impartiality could reasonably\\\\nbe questioned\\\\" simply because one of the parties is in the fourth\\\\ndegree of relationship to the judge. Section 455(b)(5), which\\\\naddresses the matter of relationship specifically, ends the\\\\ndisability at the *third* degree of relationship, and that\\\\nshould obviously govern for purposes of \\\\u00a7 455(a) as well.\\\\nSimilarly, \\\\u00a7 455(b)(1), which addresses the matter of personal bias\\\\nand prejudice specifically, contains the \\\\"extrajudicial source\\\\"\\\\nlimitation-and *that* limitation (since nothing in the text\\\\ncontradicts it) should govern for purposes of \\\\u00a7 455(a) as\\\\nwelI.22JUSTICE KENNEDY asserts that what we have said in this\\\\nparagraph contradicts the proposition, established in\\\\n*Liljeberg* v. *Health Services Acquisition Corp.,*\\\\n[486 U. S. 847](/cases/federal/us/486/847/)\\\\n(1988), that \\\\"subsections (a) and (b), while addressing many of the\\\\nsame underlying circumstances, are autonomous in operation.\\\\"\\\\n*Post,* at 566. *Liljeberg* established no such thing. It\\\\nestablished that subsection (a) requires recusal in some\\\\ncircumstances where subsection (b) does not-but that is something\\\\nquite different from \\\\"autonomy,\\\\" which in the context in which\\\\nJUSTICE KENNEDY uses it means that the one subsection is to be\\\\ninterpreted and applied without reference to the other.It is correct that subsection (a) has a \\\\"broader reach\\\\" than\\\\nsubsection (b), *post,* at 567, but the provisions obviously\\\\nhave some ground in common as well, and should not be applied\\\\ninconsistently there. *Liljeberg* concerned a respect in which\\\\nsubsection (a) *did* go beyond (b). Since subsection (a) deals\\\\nwith the *objective appearance* of partiality, any limitations\\\\ncontained in (b) that consist of a subjective-knowledge requirement\\\\nare obviously inapplicable. Subsection (a) also goes beyond (b) in\\\\nanother important respect: It covers *all* aspects of\\\\npartiality, and not merely those specifically addressed in\\\\nsubsection (b). However, when one of those aspects addressed in (b)\\\\n*is* at issue, it is poor statutory construction to interpret\\\\n(a) as nullifying the limitations (b) provides, except to the\\\\nextent the text requires. Thus, as we have said, under subsection\\\\n(a) as under (b)(5), fourth degree of kinship will not do.What is at issue in the present case *is* an aspect of\\\\n\\\\"partiality\\\\" already addressed in (b), personal bias or prejudice.\\\\nThe \\\\"objective appearance\\\\" principle of subsection (a) makes\\\\nirrelevant the subjective limitation of\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n554Petitioners suggest that applying the \\\\"extrajudicial source\\\\"\\\\nlimitation to \\\\u00a7 455(a) will cause disqualification of a trial judge\\\\nto be more easily obtainable upon remand of a case by an appellate\\\\ncourt than upon direct motion. We do not see why that necessarily\\\\nfollows; and if it does, why it is necessarily bad. Federal\\\\nappellate courts\\\' ability to assign a case to a different judge on\\\\nremand rests not on the recusal statutes alone, but on the\\\\nappellate courts\\\' statutory power to \\\\"require such further\\\\nproceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances,\\\\" 28\\\\nU. S. C. \\\\u00a7 2106. That may permit a different standard, and there\\\\nmay be pragmatic reasons for a different standard. We do not say\\\\nso-but merely say that the standards applied on remand are\\\\nirrelevant to the question before us here.For all these reasons, we think that the \\\\"extrajudicial source\\\\"\\\\ndoctrine, as we have described it, applies to \\\\u00a7 455(a). As we have\\\\ndescribed it, however, there is not much doctrine to the doctrine.\\\\nThe fact that an opinion held by a judge derives from a source\\\\noutside judicial proceedings is not a *necessary* condition\\\\nfor \\\\"bias or prejudice\\\\" recusal, since predispositions developed\\\\nduring the course of a trial will sometimes (albeit rarely)\\\\nsuffice. Nor is it a *sufficient* condition for \\\\"bias or\\\\nprejudice\\\\" recusal, since *some* opinions acquired outside the\\\\ncontext of judicial proceedings (for example, the judge\\\'s view of\\\\nthe law acquired in scholarly reading) will *not* suffice.\\\\nSince neither the presence of an extrajudicial source necessarily\\\\nestablishes bias, nor the absence of an extrajudicial source\\\\nnecessarily precludes bias, it would be(b)(l): The judge does not have to be *subjectively* biased\\\\nor prejudiced, so long as he *appears* to be so. But nothing\\\\nin subsection (a) eliminates the longstanding limitation of (b)(l),\\\\nthat \\\\"personal bias or prejudice\\\\" does not consist of a disposition\\\\nthat fails to satisfy the \\\\"extrajudicial source\\\\" doctrine. The\\\\nobjective appearance of an adverse disposition attributable to\\\\ninformation acquired in a prior trial is not an objective\\\\nappearance of personal bias or prejudice, and hence not an\\\\nobjective appearance of improper partiality.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n555better to speak of the existence of a significant (and often\\\\ndeterminative) \\\\"extrajudicial source\\\\" *factor,* than of an\\\\n\\\\"extrajudicial source\\\\" *doctrine,* in recusal\\\\njurisprudence.The facts of the present case do not require us to describe the\\\\nconsequences of that factor in complete detail. It is enough for\\\\npresent purposes to say the following: First, judicial rulings\\\\nalone almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or\\\\npartiality motion. See *United States* v. *Grinnell*\\\\nCorp., 384 U. S., at 583. In and of themselves (i. *e.,* apart\\\\nfrom surrounding comments or accompanying opinion), they cannot\\\\npossibly show reliance upon an extrajudicial source; and can only\\\\nin the rarest circumstances evidence the degree of favoritism or\\\\nantagonism required (as discussed below) when no extrajudicial\\\\nsource is involved. Almost invariably, they are proper grounds for\\\\nappeal, not for recusal. Second, opinions formed by the judge on\\\\nthe basis of facts introduced or events occurring in the course of\\\\nthe current proceedings, or of prior proceedings, do not constitute\\\\na basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a\\\\ndeep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment\\\\nimpossible. Thus, judicial remarks during the course of a trial\\\\nthat are critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to, counsel,\\\\nthe parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or\\\\npartiality challenge. They *may* do so if they reveal an\\\\nopinion that derives from an extrajudicial source; and they\\\\n*will* do so if they reveal such a high degree of favoritism\\\\nor antagonism as to make fair judgment impossible. An example of\\\\nthe latter (and perhaps of the former as well) is the statement\\\\nthat was alleged to have been made by the District Judge in\\\\n*Berger* v. *United States,* [255 U. S. 22](/cases/federal/us/255/22/) (1921), a\\\\nWorld War I espionage case against German-American defendants:\\\\"One must have a very judicial mind, indeed, not [to be]\\\\nprejudiced against the German Americans\\\\" because their \\\\"hearts are\\\\nreeking with disloyalty.\\\\" *Id.,* at 28 (internal quotation\\\\nmarks omitted). *Not* establishing bias or partiality,\\\\nhowever, are expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoy-\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n556ance, and even anger, that are within the bounds of what\\\\nimperfect men and women, even after having been confirmed as\\\\nfederal judges, sometimes display. A judge\\\'s ordinary efforts at\\\\ncourtroom administration-even a stern and shorttempered judge\\\'s\\\\nordinary efforts at courtroom administration-remain immune.IIIApplying the principles we have discussed to the facts of the\\\\npresent case is not difficult. None of the grounds petitioners\\\\nassert required disqualification. As we have described,\\\\npetitioners\\\' first recusal motion was based on rulings made, and\\\\nstatements uttered, by the District Judge during and after the 1983\\\\ntrial; and petitioner Bourgeois\\\' second recusal motion was founded\\\\non the judge\\\'s admonishment of Bourgeois\\\' counsel and codefendants.\\\\nIn their briefs here, petitioners have referred to additional\\\\nmanifestations of alleged bias in the District Judge\\\'s conduct of\\\\nthe trial below, including the questions he put to certain\\\\nwitnesses, his alleged \\\\"anti-defendant tone,\\\\" his cutting off of\\\\ntestimony said to be relevant to defendants\\\' state of mind, and his\\\\npost-trial refusal to allow petitioners to appeal *in forma\\\\npauperis.*3All of these grounds are inadequate under the principles we have\\\\ndescribed above: They consist of judicial rulings, routine trial\\\\nadministration efforts, and ordinary admonishments (whether or not\\\\nlegally supportable) to counsel and to witnesses. All occurred in\\\\nthe course of judicial proceedings, *and* neither (1) relied\\\\nupon knowledge acquired outside such proceedings nor (2) displayed\\\\ndeep-seated and unequivocal antagonism that would render fair\\\\njudgment impossible.The judgment of the Court of Appeals isAffirmed.3 Petitioners\\\' brief also complains of the District Judge\\\'s\\\\nrefusal in the 1983 trial to call petitioner Bourgeois \\\\"Father,\\\\"\\\\nasserting that this \\\\"subtly manifested animosity toward Father\\\\nBourgeois.\\\\" Brieffor Petitioners 30. As we have discussed, when\\\\nintrajudicial behavior is at issue, manifestations of animosity\\\\nmust be much more than subtle to establish bias.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n557JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN, JUSTICE STEVENS,\\\\nand JUSTICE SOUTER join, concurring in the judgment.The Court\\\'s ultimate holding that petitioners did not assert\\\\nsufficient grounds to disqualify the District Judge is\\\\nunexceptionable. Nevertheless, I confine my concurrence to the\\\\njudgment, for the Court\\\'s opinion announces a mistaken, unfortunate\\\\nprecedent in two respects. First, it accords nearly dispositive\\\\nweight to the source of a judge\\\'s alleged partiality, to the point\\\\nof stating that disqualification for intrajudicial partiality is\\\\nnot required unless it would make a fair hearing impossible.\\\\nSecond, the Court weakens the principal disqualification statute in\\\\nthe federal system, 28 U. S. C. \\\\u00a7 455, by holding-contrary to our\\\\nmost recent interpretation of the statute in *Liljeberg* v.\\\\n*Health Services Acquisition Corp.,* [486 U. S. 847](/cases/federal/us/486/847/) (1988)-that\\\\nthe broad protections afforded by subsection (a) are qualified by\\\\nlimitations explicit in the specific prohibitions of subsection\\\\n(b).IWe took this case to decide whether the reach of \\\\u00a7 455(a) is\\\\nlimited by the so-called extrajudicial source rule. I agree with\\\\nthe Court insofar as it recognizes that there is no *per* se\\\\nrule requiring that the alleged partiality arise from an\\\\nextrajudicial source. In my view, however, the Court places undue\\\\nemphasis upon the source of the challenged mindset in determining\\\\nwhether disqualification is mandated by \\\\u00a7455(a).ASection 455(a) provides that a judge \\\\"shall disqualify himself\\\\nin any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be\\\\nquestioned.\\\\" For present purposes, it should suffice to say that \\\\u00a7\\\\n455(a) is triggered by an attitude or state of mind so resistant to\\\\nfair and dispassionate inquiry as to cause a party, the public, or\\\\na reviewing court to have reasonable grounds to question the\\\\nneutral and objective character of a\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n558KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgmentjudge\\\'s rulings or findings. I think all would agree that a high\\\\nthreshold is required to satisfy this standard. Thus, under \\\\u00a7\\\\n455(a), a judge should be disqualified only if it appears that he\\\\nor she harbors an aversion, hostility or disposition of a kind that\\\\na fair-minded person could not set aside when judging the\\\\ndispute.The statute does not refer to the source of the disqualifying\\\\npartiality. And placing too much emphasis upon whether the source\\\\nis extrajudicial or intrajudicial distracts from the central\\\\ninquiry. One of the very objects of law is the impartiality of its\\\\njudges in fact and appearance. So in one sense it could be said\\\\nthat any disqualifying state of mind must originate from a source\\\\noutside law itself. That metaphysical inquiry, however, is beside\\\\nthe point. The relevant consideration under \\\\u00a7 455(a) is the\\\\nappearance of partiality, see *Liljeberg, supra,* at 860, not\\\\nwhere it originated or how it was disclosed. If, for instance, a\\\\njudge presiding over a retrial should state, based upon facts\\\\nadduced and opinions formed during the original cause, an intent to\\\\nensure that one side or the other shall prevail, there can be\\\\nlittle doubt that he or she must recuse. Cf. *Rugenstein* v.\\\\n*Ottenheimer,* 78 Ore. 371, 372, 152 P. 215, 216 (1915)\\\\n(reversing for judge\\\'s failure to disqualify himself on retrial,\\\\nwhere judge had stated: \\\\"\\\'This case may be tried again, and it will\\\\nbe tried before me. I will see to that. And I will see that the\\\\nwoman gets another verdict and judgment that will stand\\\' \\\\").I agree, then, with the Court\\\'s rejection of the *per se*\\\\nrule applied by the Court of Appeals, which provides that \\\\"matters\\\\narising out of the course of judicial proceedings are not a proper\\\\nbasis for recusal\\\\" under \\\\u00a7 455(a). [973 F.2d\\\\n910](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/973/910/) (CAll 1992). But the Court proceeds to discern in the\\\\nstatute an extrajudicial source interpretive doctrine, under which\\\\nthe source of an alleged deep-seated predisposition is a primary\\\\nfactor in the analysis. The Court\\\'s candid struggle to find a\\\\npersuasive rationale for this approach demonstrates that prior\\\\nattempts along those lines have fallen\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n559somewhat short of the mark. This, I submit, is due to the fact\\\\nthat the doctrine crept into the jurisprudence more by accident\\\\nthan design.The term \\\\"extrajudicial source,\\\\" though not the interpretive\\\\ndoctrine bearing its name, has appeared in only one of our previous\\\\ncases: *United States* v. *Grinnell Corp.,* [384 U. S. 563](/cases/federal/us/384/563/) (1966).\\\\nRespondents in *Grinnell* alleged that the trial judge had a\\\\npersonal bias against them, and sought his disqualification and a\\\\nnew trial under 28 U. S. C. \\\\u00a7 144. That statute, like \\\\u00a7 455(b)(1),\\\\nrequires disqualification for \\\\"bias or prejudice.\\\\" In denying\\\\nrespondents\\\' claim, the Court stated that \\\\"[t]he alleged bias and\\\\nprejudice to be disqualifying must stem from an extrajudicial\\\\nsource and result in an opinion on the merits on some basis other\\\\nthan what the judge learned from his participation in the case.\\\\"\\\\n384 U. S., at 583.Although *Grinnell\\\'s* articulation of the extrajudicial\\\\nsource rule has a categorical aspect about it, the decision, on\\\\ncloser examination, proves not to erect a *per se* barrier.\\\\nAfter reciting what appeared to be an absolute rule, the Court\\\\nproceeded to make a few additional points: that certain in-court\\\\nstatements by the judge \\\\"reflected no more than his view that, if\\\\nthe facts were as the Government alleged, stringent relief was\\\\ncalled for\\\\"; that during the trial the judge \\\\"repeatedly stated\\\\nthat he had not made up his mind on the merits\\\\"; and that another\\\\nof the judge\\\'s challenged statements did not \\\\"manifes[t] a closed\\\\nmind on the merits of the case,\\\\" but rather was \\\\"a terse way\\\\" of\\\\nreiterating a prior ruling. *Ibid.* Had we meant the\\\\nextrajudicial source doctrine to be dispositive under \\\\u00a7 144, those\\\\nfurther remarks would have been unnecessary.More to the point, *Grinnell* provides little justification\\\\nfor its announcement of the extrajudicial source rule, relying only\\\\nupon a citation to *Berger* v. *United States,* [255 U. S. 22](/cases/federal/us/255/22/), 31 (1921).\\\\nThe cited passage from *Berger,* it turns out, does not bear\\\\nthe weight *Grinnell* places on it, but stands for the more\\\\nlimited proposition that the alleged bias \\\\"must be\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n560KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgmentbased upon something other than rulings in the case.\\\\" 255 U. S.,\\\\nat 31. *Berger,* in turn, relies upon an earlier case\\\\nadvancing the same narrow proposition, *Ex parte American Steel\\\\nBarrel Co.,* [230 U.\\\\nS. 35](/cases/federal/us/230/35/),44 (1913) (predecessor of \\\\u00a7 144 \\\\"was never intended to\\\\nenable a discontented litigant to oust a judge because of adverse\\\\nrulings made, for such rulings are reviewable otherwise\\\\"). There is\\\\na real difference, of course, between a rule providing that bias\\\\nmust arise from an extrajudicial source and one providing that\\\\njudicial rulings alone cannot sustain a challenge for bias.\\\\n*Grinnell,* therefore, provides a less than satisfactory\\\\nrationale for reading the extrajudicial source doctrine into \\\\u00a7 144\\\\nor the disqualification statutes at issue here. It should come as\\\\nlittle surprise, then, that the Court does not enlist\\\\n*Grinnell* to support its adoption of the doctrine.The Court adverts to, but does not ratify, *ante,* at 549,\\\\nan alternative rationale: the requirement in \\\\u00a7 144 that a\\\\nlitigant\\\'s recusal affidavit \\\\"be filed not less than 10 days before\\\\nthe beginning of the term at which the proceeding is to be heard,\\\\"\\\\nunless \\\\"good cause [is] shown for failure to file it within such\\\\ntime.\\\\" If a litigant seeking disqualification must file an\\\\naffidavit 10 days before the beginning of the term, the argument\\\\ngoes, the alleged bias cannot arise from events occurring or facts\\\\nadduced during the litigation. See *Berger, supra,* at 34-35.\\\\nThat rationale fails as well. The 10-day rule has been an\\\\nanachronism since 1963, when Congress abolished formal terms of\\\\ncourt for United States district courts. See 28 U. S. C. \\\\u00a7 138. In\\\\nany event, the rule always had an exception for good cause. And\\\\neven if the 10-day requirement could justify reading the\\\\nextrajudicial source rule into \\\\u00a7 144, it would not suffice as to\\\\n\\\\u00a7455(a) or \\\\u00a7 455(b)(1), which have no analogous requirement.The Court is correct to reject yet another view, which has\\\\ngained currency in several Courts of Appeals, that the term\\\\n\\\\"personal\\\\" in \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 144 and 455(b)(1) provides a textual home for the\\\\nextrajudicial source doctrine. *Ante,* at 548-550.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n561Given the flaws with prior attempts to justify the doctrine, the\\\\nCourt advances a new rationale: The doctrine arises from the\\\\npejorative connotation of the term \\\\"bias or prejudice\\\\" in \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 144\\\\nand 455(b)(1) and the converse of the term \\\\"impartiality\\\\" in \\\\u00a7\\\\n455(a). *Ante,* at 550, 552-553. This rationale, as the Court\\\\nacknowledges, does not amount to much. It is beyond dispute that\\\\nchallenged opinions or predispositions arising from outside the\\\\ncourtroom need not be disqualifying. See, *e. g., United\\\\nStates* v. *Conforte,* [624 F.2d\\\\n869](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/624/869/), 878-881 (CA9), cert. denied, 449 U. S. 1012 (1980).\\\\nLikewise, prejudiced opinions based upon matters disclosed at trial\\\\nmay rise to the level where recusal is required. See, *e. g.,\\\\nUnited States* v. *Holland,* [655 F.2d\\\\n44](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/655/44/) (CA5 1981); *Nicodemus* v. *Chrysler Corp.,*\\\\n[596 F.2d\\\\n152](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/596/152/), 155-157, and n. 10 (CA6 1979). From this, the Court is\\\\ncorrect to conclude that an allegation concerning some\\\\nextrajudicial matter is neither a necessary nor a sufficient\\\\ncondition for disqualification under any of the recusal statutes.\\\\n*Ante,* at 554-555. The Court nonetheless proceeds, without\\\\nmuch explanation, to find \\\\"a significant (and often determinative)\\\\n\\\'extrajudicial source\\\' *factor\\\\"* in those statutes.\\\\n*Ante,* at 555 (emphasis in original).This last step warrants further attention. I recognize along\\\\nwith the Court that, as an empirical matter, doubts about a judge\\\'s\\\\nimpartiality seldom have merit when the challenged mindset arises\\\\nas a result of some judicial proceeding. The dichotomy between\\\\nextrajudicial and intrajudicial sources, then, has some slight\\\\nutility; it provides a convenient shorthand to explain how courts\\\\nhave confronted the disqualification issue in circumstances that\\\\nrecur with some frequency.To take a common example, litigants (like petitioners here)\\\\noften seek disqualification based upon a judge\\\'s prior\\\\nparticipation, in a judicial capacity, in some related litigation.\\\\nThose allegations are meritless in most instances, and their prompt\\\\nrejection is important so the case can proceed. Judges, if faithful\\\\nto their oath, approach every aspect of\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n562KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgmenteach case with a neutral and objective disposition. They\\\\nunderstand their duty to render decisions upon a proper record and\\\\nto disregard earlier judicial contacts with a case or party.Some may argue that a judge will feel the \\\\"motivation to\\\\nvindicate a prior conclusion\\\\" when confronted with a question for\\\\nthe second or third time, for instance, upon trial after a remand.\\\\nRatner, Disqualification of Judges for Prior Judicial Actions, 3\\\\nHow. L. J. 228, 229-230 (1957). Still, we accept the notion that\\\\nthe \\\\"conscientious judge will, as far as possible, make himself\\\\naware of his biases of this character, and, by that very\\\\nself-knowledge, nullify their effect.\\\\" *In* re *J.* P.\\\\n*Linahan, Inc.,* 138 F.2d 650, 652 (CA2 1943). The acquired\\\\nskill and capacity to disregard extraneous matters is one of the\\\\nrequisites of judicial office. As a matter of sound administration,\\\\nmoreover, it may be necessary and prudent to permit judges to\\\\npreside over successive causes involving the same parties or\\\\nissues. See Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings for the United\\\\nStates District Courts, Rule 4(a) (\\\\"The original motion shall be\\\\npresented promptly to the judge of the district court who presided\\\\nat the movant\\\'s trial and sentenced him, or, if the judge who\\\\nimposed sentence was not the trial judge, then it shall go to the\\\\njudge who was in charge of that part of the proceedings being\\\\nattacked by the movant\\\\"). The public character of the prior and\\\\npresent proceedings tends to reinforce the resolve of the judge to\\\\nweigh with care the propriety of his or her decision to hear the\\\\ncase.Out of this reconciliation of principle and practice comes the\\\\nrecognition that a judge\\\'s prior judicial experience and contacts\\\\nneed not, and often do not, give rise to reasonable questions\\\\nconcerning impartiality.BThere is no justification, however, for a strict rule dismissing\\\\nallegations of intrajudicial partiality, or the appearance\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n563thereof, in every case. A judge may find it difficult to put\\\\naside views formed during some earlier proceeding. In that instance\\\\nwe would expect the judge to heed the judicial oath and step down,\\\\nbut that does not always occur. If through obduracy, honest\\\\nmistake, or simple inability to attain selfknowledge the judge\\\\nfails to acknowledge a disqualifying predisposition or\\\\ncircumstance, an appellate court must order recusal no matter what\\\\nthe source. As I noted above, the central inquiry under \\\\u00a7 455(a) is\\\\nthe appearance of partiality, not its place of origin.I must part, then, from the Court\\\'s adoption of a standard that\\\\nplaces all but dispositive weight upon the source of the alleged\\\\ndisqualification. The Court holds that opinions arising during the\\\\ncourse of judicial proceedings require disqualification under \\\\u00a7\\\\n455(a) only if they \\\\"display a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism\\\\nthat would make fair judgment impossible.\\\\" *Ante,* at 555.\\\\nThat standard is not a fair interpretation of the statute, and is\\\\nquite insufficient to serve and protect the integrity of the\\\\ncourts. In practical effect, the Court\\\'s standard will be difficult\\\\nto distinguish from a *per se* extrajudicial source rule, the\\\\nvery result the Court professes to reject.The Court\\\'s \\\\"impossibility of fair judgment\\\\" test bears little\\\\nresemblance to the objective standard Congress adopted in \\\\u00a7 455(a):\\\\nwhether a judge\\\'s \\\\"impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\\\\"\\\\nThe statutory standard, which the Court preserves for allegations\\\\nof an extrajudicial nature, asks whether there is an appearance of\\\\npartiality. See *Liljeberg,* 486 U. S., at 860 (\\\\"[t]he goal of\\\\nsection 455(a) is to avoid even the appearance of partiality\\\\")\\\\n(internal quotation marks omitted); *United States* v.\\\\n*Chantal,* [902 F.2d\\\\n1018](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/902/1018/), 1023 (CA1 1990). The Court\\\'s standard, in contrast, asks\\\\nwhether fair judgment is impossible, and if this test demands some\\\\ndirect inquiry to the judge\\\'s actual, rather than apparent, state\\\\nof mind, it defeats the underlying goal of \\\\u00a7 455(a): to avoid the\\\\nappearance of partiality even when no partiality exists.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n564KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgmentAnd in all events, the \\\\"impossibility of fair judgment\\\\" standard\\\\nremains troubling due to its limited, almost preclusive character.\\\\nAs I interpret it, a \\\\u00a7 455(a) challenge would fail even if it were\\\\nshown that an unfair hearing were likely, for it could be argued\\\\nthat a fair hearing would be possible nonetheless. The integrity of\\\\nthe courts, as well as the interests of the parties and the public,\\\\nare ill served by this rule. There are bound to be circumstances\\\\nwhere a judge\\\'s demeanor or attitude would raise reasonable\\\\nquestions concerning impartiality but would not devolve to the\\\\npoint where one would think fair judgment impossible.When the prevailing standard of conduct imposed by the law for\\\\nmany of society\\\'s enterprises is reasonableness, it seems most\\\\ninappropriate to say that a judge is subject to disqualification\\\\nonly if concerns about his or her predisposed state of mind, or\\\\nother improper connections to the case, make a fair hearing\\\\nimpossible. That is too lenient a test when the integrity of the\\\\njudicial system is at stake. Disputes arousing deep passions often\\\\ncome to the courtroom, and justice may appear imperfect to parties\\\\nand their supporters disappointed by the outcome. This we cannot\\\\nchange. We can, however, enforce society\\\'s legitimate expectation\\\\nthat judges maintain, in fact and appearance, the conviction and\\\\ndiscipline to resolve those disputes with detachment and\\\\nimpartiality.The standard that ought to be adopted for all allegations of an\\\\napparent fixed predisposition, extrajudicial or otherwise, follows\\\\nfrom the statute itself: Disqualification is required if an\\\\nobjective observer would entertain reasonable questions about the\\\\njudge\\\'s impartiality. If a judge\\\'s attitude or state of mind leads\\\\na detached observer to conclude that a fair and impartial hearing\\\\nis unlikely, the judge must be disqualified. Indeed, in such\\\\ncircumstances, I should think that any judge who understands the\\\\njudicial office and oath would be the first to insist that another\\\\njudge hear the case.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n565In matters of ethics, appearance and reality often converge as\\\\none. See *Offutt* v. *United States,* [348 U. S. 11](/cases/federal/us/348/11/), 14 (1954)\\\\n(\\\\"[J]ustice must satisfy the appearance of justice\\\\"); *Ex parte\\\\nMcCarthy,* [1924] 1 K. B. 256, 259 (1923) (\\\\"[J]ustice should not\\\\nonly be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be\\\\ndone\\\\"). I do not see how the appearance of fairness and neutrality\\\\ncan obtain if the bare possibility of a fair hearing is all that\\\\nthe law requires. Cf. *Marshall* v. *Jerrico, Inc.,*\\\\n[446 U. S. 238](/cases/federal/us/446/238/),\\\\n242 (1980) (noting the importance of \\\\"preserv[ing] both the\\\\nappearance and reality of fairness,\\\\" which \\\\"\\\'generat[es] the\\\\nfeeling, so important to a popular government, that justice has\\\\nbeen done\\\'\\\'\\\') (quoting *Joint AntiFascist Refugee Comm.* v.\\\\n*McGrath,* [341\\\\nU. S. 123](/cases/federal/us/341/123/), 172 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring)).Although the source of an alleged disqualification may be\\\\nrelevant in determining whether there is a reasonable appearance of\\\\nimpartiality, that determination can be explained in a\\\\nstraightforward manner without resort to a nearly dispositive\\\\nextrajudicial source factor. I would apply the statute as written\\\\nto all charges of partiality, extrajudicial or otherwise, secure in\\\\nmy view that district and appellate judges possess the wisdom and\\\\ngood sense to distinguish substantial from insufficient allegations\\\\nand that our rules, as so interpreted, are sufficient to correct\\\\nthe occasional departure.IIThe Court\\\'s effort to discern an \\\\"often dispositive\\\\"\\\\nextrajudicial source factor in \\\\u00a7 455(a) leads it to an additional\\\\nerror along the way. As noted above, the Court begins by explaining\\\\nthat the pejorative connotation of the term \\\\"bias or prejudice\\\\"\\\\ndemonstrates that the source of an alleged bias is significant\\\\nunder \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 144 and 455(b)(1). The Court goes on to state that \\\\"it is\\\\nunreasonable to interpret \\\\u00a7 455(a) (unless the language\\\\n*requires* it) as implicitly eliminating a limitation\\\\nexplicitly set forth in \\\\u00a7 455(b).\\\\" *Ante,* at 553 (emphasis in\\\\noriginal). That interpretation, the Court reasons, \\\\"would\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n566KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgmentcause the statute, in a significant sense, to contradict\\\\nitself.\\\\" *Ante,* at 552.We rejected that very understanding of the interplay between \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7\\\\n455(a) and (b) in *Liljeberg* v. *Health Services\\\\nAcquisition Corp.,* [486 U. S. 847](/cases/federal/us/486/847/) (1988).\\\\nRespondent in *Liljeberg* sought to disqualify a district\\\\njudge under \\\\u00a7 455(a) because the judge (in his capacity as trustee\\\\nof a university) had a financial interest in the litigation, albeit\\\\nan interest of which he was unaware. Petitioner opposed\\\\ndisqualification, and asked us to interpret \\\\u00a7455(a) in light of\\\\n\\\\u00a7455(b)(4), which provides for disqualification only if the judge\\\\n\\\\"knows that he, individually or as a fiduciary, ... has a financial\\\\ninterest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the\\\\nproceeding.\\\\" According to petitioner, the explicit knowledge\\\\nrequirement in \\\\u00a7455(b)(4) indicated that Congress intended a\\\\nsimilar requirement to govern \\\\u00a7 455(a). See *Liljeberg, 486*\\\\nU. S., at 859, n. 8. Otherwise, petitioner contended, the knowledge\\\\nrequirement in \\\\u00a7455(b)(4) would be meaningless. *Ibid.*In holding for respondent, we emphasized that there were\\\\n\\\\"important differences\\\\" between subsections (a) and (b), and\\\\nconcluded that the explicit knowledge requirement under \\\\u00a7 455(b)(4)\\\\ndoes not apply to disqualification motions filed under \\\\u00a7455(a).\\\\n*Id.,* at 859-860, and n. 8. *Liljeberg* teaches,\\\\ncontrary to what the Court says today, that limitations inherent in\\\\nthe various provisions of \\\\u00a7 455(b) do not, by their own force,\\\\ngovern \\\\u00a7 455(a) as well. The structure of \\\\u00a7 455 makes clear that\\\\nsubsections (a) and (b), while addressing many of the same\\\\nunderlying circumstances, are autonomous in operation. Section\\\\n455(b) commences with the charge that a judge \\\\"shall also\\\\ndisqualify himself in the following circumstances\\\\"; Congress\\\'\\\\ninclusion of the word \\\\"also\\\\" indicates that subsections (a) and (b)\\\\nhave independent force. Section 455(e), which permits parties to\\\\nwaive grounds for disqualification arising under \\\\u00a7 455(a), but not\\\\n\\\\u00a7 455(b), provides further specific textual confirmation of the\\\\ndifference.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n567The principal distinction between \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 455(a) and (b) is apparent\\\\nfrom the face of the statute. Section 455(b) delineates specific\\\\ncircumstances where recusal is mandated; these include instances of\\\\nactual bias as well as specific instances where actual bias is\\\\nassumed. See 28 U. S. C. \\\\u00a7 455(b)(1) (\\\\"personal bias or\\\\nprejudice\\\\"); \\\\u00a7 455(b)(2) (judge \\\\"served as [a] lawyer in the matter\\\\nin controversy\\\\" while in private practice); \\\\u00a7 455(b)(3) (same while\\\\njudge served in government employment); \\\\u00a7 455(b)(4) (\\\\"financial\\\\ninterest\\\\" in the litigation); \\\\u00a7 455(b)(5) (judge \\\\"within the third\\\\ndegree of relationship\\\\" to a party, lawyer, or material witness).\\\\nSection 455(a), in contrast, addresses the appearance of\\\\npartiality, guaranteeing not only that a partisan judge will not\\\\nsit, but also that no reasonable person will have that suspicion.\\\\nSee *Liljeberg, supra,* at 860.Because the appearance of partiality may arise when in fact\\\\nthere is none, see, *e. g., Hall* v. *Small Business\\\\nAdmin.,* [695 F.2d\\\\n175](http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/695/175/), 179 (CA5 1983); *United States* v. *Ritter, 540*\\\\nF. 2d 459, 464 (CAlO), cert. denied, 429 U. S. 951 (1976), the\\\\nreach of \\\\u00a7 455(a) is broader than that of \\\\u00a7 455(b). One of the\\\\ndistinct concerns addressed by \\\\u00a7 455(a) is that the appearance of\\\\nimpartiality be assured whether or not the alleged disqualifying\\\\ncircumstance is also addressed under \\\\u00a7 455(b). In this respect, the\\\\nstatutory scheme ought to be understood as extending \\\\u00a7 455(a)\\\\nbeyond the scope of \\\\u00a7 455(b), and not confining \\\\u00a7 455(a) in large\\\\npart, as the Court would have it. See *ante,* at 553-554, n.\\\\n2. The broader reach of \\\\u00a7 455(a) is confirmed by the rule\\\\npermitting its more comprehensive provisions, but not the absolute\\\\nrules of \\\\u00a7 455(b), to be waived. See 28 U. S. C. \\\\u00a7455(e). And in\\\\nall events, I suspect that any attempt to demarcate an \\\\"area of\\\\noverlap\\\\" *(ante,* at 553) between \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 455(a) and (b) will prove\\\\nelusive in many instances.Given the design of the statute, then, it is wrong to impose the\\\\nexplicit limitations of \\\\u00a7 455(b) upon the more extensive\\\\nprotections afforded by \\\\u00a7 455(a). See *Liljeberg, supra,*\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n568KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgmentat 859-861, and n. 8. The Court\\\'s construction of the statute\\\\nundercuts the protection Congress put in place when enacting \\\\u00a7\\\\n455(a) as an independent guarantee of judicial impartiality.IIIThe Court describes in all necessary detail the unimpressive\\\\nallegations of partiality, and the appearance thereof, in this\\\\ncase. The contested rulings and comments by the trial judge were\\\\ndesigned to ensure the orderly conduct of petitioners\\\' trial.\\\\nNothing in those rulings or comments raises any inference of bias\\\\nor partiality. I concur in the judgment.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n**Materials**\\\\n\\\\n* [Oral Arguments](#tab-audio-and-media)\\\\n\\\\n|  |\\\\n| --- |\\\\n| [Oral Argument - November 03, 1993](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1993/92-6921) |\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n**Search This Case**\\\\n\\\\n**[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Liteky+v.+United+States&as_sdt=2006 \\\\"Law - Google Scholar\\\\")**\\\\n\\\\n**[Google Books](https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=Liteky+v.+United+States \\\\"Law - Google Books\\\\")**\\\\n\\\\n**[Google Web](https://www.google.com/search?q=Liteky+v.+United+States \\\\"Law - Google Web\\\\")**\\\\n\\\\n**[Google News](https://news.google.com/news/search?q=Liteky+v.+United+States \\\\"Law - Google News\\\\")**\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nLiteky v.
