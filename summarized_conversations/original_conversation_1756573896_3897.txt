{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<function_calls>\n<ask>\nYou\'re right that SSH would be helpful for a more secure and reliable connection to your server. Since we\'re working with a web hosting environment that has cPanel, here are your options:\n\n## SSH Access Options\n\n1. **SSH from your local computer**:\n   - Install an SSH client on your computer (like OpenSSH for Linux/Mac or PuTTY for Windows)\n   - Request SSH access from your hosting provider if not already enabled\n   - Use the SSH credentials (usually different from FTP) to connect\n   - Once connected via SSH, you can use commands like `scp` or `rsync` to upload files\n\n2. **SSH Terminal in cPanel**:\n   - Many cPanel installations include an SSH Terminal feature\n   - Look for "Terminal" or "SSH Access" in your cPanel dashboard\n   - This lets you use SSH commands directly from your browser\n   - No local software installation needed\n\n3. **Git Deployment via SSH**:\n   - If your project is in a Git repository\n   - Set up SSH keys in cPanel (look for "SSH Access" > "Manage SSH Keys")\n   - Clone your repository directly to the server\n\nWould you like me to create a guide for any of these SSH-based deployment methods? Or would you prefer to stick with the cPanel File Manager approach but need additional guidance?\n</ask>\n</function_calls>', 'tool_calls': None}
