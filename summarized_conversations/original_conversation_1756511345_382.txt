{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '# DNS Configuration Guide for Namecheap\n\nPerfect! Namecheap has a specific way to configure DNS records. Here\'s a step-by-step guide for setting up your GitHub Pages with Namecheap:\n\n## Setting Up A Records in Namecheap\n\n1. **Log in to your Namecheap account**\n\n2. **Go to "Domain List" and click "Manage" next to legal-prejudice-analysis.com**\n\n3. **Click on the "Advanced DNS" tab**\n\n4. **For the apex domain (no www), add A Records as follows:**\n   - For each A record:\n     - **Type**: A Record\n     - **Host**: @ (Namecheap uses @ for the apex domain)\n     - **Value**: 185.199.108.153\n     - **TTL**: Automatic (or 1 hour)\n   \n   - Repeat this process to add all four GitHub Pages IP addresses:\n     - 185.199.108.153\n     - 185.199.109.153\n     - 185.199.110.153\n     - 185.199.111.153\n\n5. **For the www subdomain, add a CNAME record:**\n   - **Type**: CNAME Record\n   - **Host**: www\n   - **Value**: yourusername.github.io. (replace with your GitHub username)\n   - **TTL**: Automatic (or 1 hour)\n\n   **Important**: Make sure to include the trailing dot after github.io\n\n## Namecheap-Specific Tips\n\n- **Removing Default Records**: You may need to remove any default records that Namecheap created automatically\n- **Parking Page**: Disable any "Parking Page" or "Web Hosting" features if they\'re enabled\n- **DNS Propagation**: Namecheap typically has fast DNS propagation, but it can still take up to a few hours\n\n## Verifying Your Configuration\n\nAfter setting up the records:\n\n1. **Wait 15-30 minutes** for initial DNS propagation\n2. **Check your GitHub repository settings** to ensure your custom domain is still configured\n3. **Visit your site** at both https://legal-prejudice-analysis.com and https://www.legal-prejudice-analysis.com\n\n## Troubleshooting Namecheap DNS Issues\n\nIf you encounter issues:\n\n1. **Check for Typos**: Ensure all values are entered exactly as shown\n2. **Verify @ Symbol**: Make sure you\'re using @ for the apex domain\n3. **Check CNAME Format**: Ensure your GitHub username is correct and includes the trailing dot\n4. **DNS Propagation**: Use [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/) to verify your records are propagating correctly\n\n## Namecheap SSL/TLS Settings\n\nNamecheap may offer its own SSL options, but for GitHub Pages:\n\n1. **Do not purchase or activate Namecheap\'s SSL** for this domain\n2. **Let GitHub Pages handle the SSL certificate** automatically\n3. **If prompted about SSL in Namecheap**, choose options that don\'t interfere with external SSL\n\nOnce your DNS is properly configured, GitHub Pages should automatically provision an SSL certificate within 24 hours.\n\n<function_calls>\n<ask>\n# Namecheap DNS Configuration for GitHub Pages\n\nGreat!
