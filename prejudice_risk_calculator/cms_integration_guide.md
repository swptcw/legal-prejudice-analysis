## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - **Issue**: API requests return 401 Unauthorized
   - **Solution**: Verify your API key is correct and properly formatted in the Authorization header

2. **Missing Data in Assessments**
   - **Issue**: Assessments created from CMS are missing information
   - **Solution**: Check field mapping configuration and ensure required fields are properly mapped

3. **Integration Timeout**
   - **Issue**: API requests time out
   - **Solution**: Check network connectivity, increase timeout settings, and verify API server status

4. **Duplicate Assessments**
   - **Issue**: Multiple assessments created for the same case
   - **Solution**: Implement deduplication logic using the case ID as a reference

5. **Sync Failures**
   - **Issue**: Changes in CMS not reflected in assessments
   - **Solution**: Check webhook configuration, verify event triggers, and check error logs
