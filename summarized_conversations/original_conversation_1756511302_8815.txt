Now that you\'ve committed the `.github/superninja.yml` file to your repository, the SuperNinja App should begin recognizing and applying your configuration settings.\n\n## What Happens Next\n\nThe SuperNinja App will now:\n\n1. **Detect Your Configuration**: The app will scan your repository and detect the new configuration file\n2. **Validate Settings**: It will check that all settings are valid and properly formatted\n3. **Apply Configuration**: The app will begin applying your settings to enable the specified features\n4. **Initialize Integrations**: Any integrations you\'ve enabled will be set up\n\n## Recommended Next Steps\n\n### 1. Check for Configuration Success\n\nLook for any notifications or indicators that the configuration was successfully applied:\n- Check for any notification emails from GitHub or the SuperNinja App\n- Look for any new issues created in your repository by the app\n- Check the app\'s dashboard or status page if available\n\n### 2. Set Up Required Secrets\n\nFor the Docker integration and other features to work properly, you\'ll likely need to add these secrets to your repository:\n\n1. Go to your repository on GitHub\n2. Click on "Settings" → "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"\n3. Click "New repository secret"\n4. Add these recommended secrets:\n   - `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username\n   - `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub access token (not your actual password)\n   - `API_KEY_CLIO`: If you\'re using Clio integration\n   - `API_KEY_PRACTICE_PANTHER`: If you\'re using Practice Panther integration\n   - `API_KEY_MYCASE`: If you\'re using MyCase integration\n\n### 3. Test a Simple Workflow\n\nTry testing a simple workflow to verify the app is working:\n\n1. **Create a small documentation change**:\n   - Edit a file in your `docs` directory\n   - Commit and push the change\n   - Check if the documentation is automatically updated\n\n2. **Create a test issue**:\n   - Create a new issue that includes the word "docker" in the title or description\n   - Check if it gets automatically labeled with "docker"\n   - Check if it gets automatically assigned based on your configuration\n\n### 4. Create Supporting Files\n\nTo fully utilize the configuration, consider creating these supporting files:\n\n1. **Issue Templates**:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE\n   ```\n   Then create templates like:\n   - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`\n   - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`\n\n2. **Pull Request Template**:\n   - Create `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`\n\n### 5. Monitor App Activity\n\nKeep an eye on the app\'s activity in your repository:\n- Check for any automated commits or pull requests\n- Monitor any comments added to issues or PRs\n- Watch for any workflow runs triggered by the app\n\n## Would You Like Help With:\n\n1. Creating issue and pull request templates?\n2. Setting up specific GitHub secrets?\n3. Testing a particular feature of the configuration?\n4. Troubleshooting if you encounter any issues with the app?\n5. Customizing any specific part of the configuration?\n\n<function_calls>\n<ask>\nExcellent!
