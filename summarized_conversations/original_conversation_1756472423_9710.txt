{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Great! The Legal Prejudice Risk Calculator is now up and running. You can access it at:\n\n[Legal Prejudice Risk Calculator](https://8888-87af24b5-c108-4772-b920-367f7f66322e.h1107.daytona.work/templates/index.html)\n\n## What I\'ve Built\n\nI\'ve created an interactive web application that implements the risk assessment methodology from your Legal Prejudice Analysis Framework. This tool allows legal practitioners to:\n\n1. **Systematically evaluate potential judicial prejudice** through a structured assessment of:\n   - Relationship-based factors (financial interests, personal relationships, etc.)\n   - Conduct-based factors (in-court statements, procedural rulings, etc.)\n   - Contextual factors (historical patterns, procedural irregularities, etc.)\n\n2. **Calculate risk scores** based on likelihood and impact ratings for each factor\n\n3. **Visualize risk** through an interactive risk matrix\n\n4. **Receive tailored recommendations** based on the calculated risk level\n\n5. **Document concerns** with detailed notes for each factor\n\n## How to Use the Tool\n\n1. Navigate through the tabs to assess different categories of prejudice factors:\n   - Start with "Relationship-Based" factors\n   - Continue to "Conduct-Based" factors\n   - Finish with "Contextual" factors\n\n2. For each factor:\n   - Rate the likelihood (1-5)\n   - Rate the impact (1-5)\n   - Add detailed notes if applicable\n\n3. On the "Results" tab:\n   - Enter case information\n   - Click "Calculate Results" to generate:\n     - Overall risk score and risk level\n     - Risk matrix visualization\n     - Recommended actions based on risk level\n     - Summary of highest risk factors\n\n4. You can save your assessment as a PDF (placeholder functionality) or reset the form to start a new assessment.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nThe application is built using:\n- HTML5 for structure\n- CSS3 for styling\n- JavaScript for interactivity\n- Python\'s built-in HTTP server for serving the application\n\nThe code is organized into:\n- `templates/index.html` - The main application interface\n- `css/styles.css` - Styling for the application\n- `js/script.js` - Interactive functionality and risk calculations\n- `server.py` - A simple HTTP server (though we\'re using Python\'s built-in server for now)\n- `README.md` - Documentation on how to use the application\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\nThis is a basic implementation that could be enhanced with:\n1. Server-side data storage for saving assessments\n2. User authentication system\n3. Enhanced PDF export functionality\n4. Bayesian probability calculator integration\n5. Pattern detection analytics\n6. Case management integration\n\nWould you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?\n<function_calls>\n<complete>\n<!-- This tool indicates successful completion of all tasks -->\n<!-- The system will stop execution after this tool is used -->\n</complete>\n</function_calls>', 'tool_calls': None}
