This section also can address issues such as the existence of an arbitration agreement and insurance coverage.\\\\n\\\\n**Legal Analysis** \\\\u2013 An assessment of any significant legal issues, including the benefits and risks of obtaining a binding judicial precedent.\\\\n\\\\n**Strengths and Weaknesses** \\\\u2013 A succinct outline of the strengths and weaknesses of your factual and legal position, including such factors as the substance and impact of the evidence, the availability and quality of witnesses, the sympathy or not of the adversary, the friendliness or hostility of the tribunal, and the competence and experience of opposing counsel.\\\\n\\\\n**Budget** \\\\u2013 The anticipated legal budget.\\\\n\\\\n**Possible Results and Probabilities** \\\\u2013 An assessment of damages, including possible results, probabilities and discounted values, and anticipated litigation expenses.\\\\u00a0 This type of probability assessment is well-understood by business executives, who customarily base business decisions on similar analyses.\\\\u00a0 The case value assessment includes percentage estimates based on various potential outcomes.\\\\u00a0 Although percentages may imply more precision than is justified, they convey information more clearly than imprecise adjectives frequently used in describing litigation risk.\\\\u00a0 For example, does \\\\"likely\\\\" mean 51% or 80%?\\\\u00a0 Is a \\\\"strong defense\\\\" one that will prevail 60% of the time or 25% of the time?\\\\u00a0 A business person is entitled to know as clearly as possible what his or her attorney has in mind.\\\\u00a0 Where possible results fall on a customary probability curve, the damage assessment assigns high, median and low results and probabilities of 75%, 50% and 25%, respectively, to these results.\\\\n\\\\n**Conclusion and Recommendation** \\\\u2013 Conclusions and recommendations may run the gamut from early efforts to settle or mediate the dispute, through targeted discovery with an eye towards settlement, to full-bore litigation. A litigation risk assessment ordinarily should be from five to fifteen pages in length.\\\\u00a0 Even a relatively complicated dispute can normally be summarized in fewer than ten pages.\\\\n\\\\nMost importantly, every effort should be made to prepare the initial litigation risk assessment early \\\\u2013 generally no later than 30 days after notice of the claim or litigation has been received in defense cases and prior to commencement in plaintiff litigation.\\\\u00a0 Although information will be incomplete at the time of an initial litigation risk assessment, even a defendant facing an unanticipated lawsuit can ordinarily identify many of the key facts relatively quickly by reviewing documents, interviewing employees, reviewing publicly available information or simply asking the other side.\\\\u00a0 Early case assessment often provides a picture of a case that will not change dramatically by the end of expensive discovery and aggressive litigation.\\\\u00a0 It has been said, with some justification, that the litigation process spends 90% of its time attempting to discover the last 10% of the facts of a dispute.\\\\u00a0 This high cost may outweigh the value of the information obtained.\\\\n\\\\nAn initial litigation risk assessment becomes the business plan for the litigation.\\\\u00a0 This assessment should be reviewed, and if necessary revised, as the litigation progresses and more facts become available.\\\\u00a0 The current discounted value of the case provides a metric against which settlement opportunities and the costs of further litigation can be evaluated.\\\\n\\\\nWhat is the value of this process?\\\\u00a0 Clients with whom we have worked to implement disciplined case management and rigorous early case evaluation report:\\\\n\\\\n* Significant reductions in the number of pending cases.\\\\u00a0 Dockets may be reduced by half or more as cases are aggressively evaluated early in the process.\\\\n* Significant reductions in the overall expense of litigation, including both payouts and attorneys\\\' fees and expenses.\\\\u00a0 Again, reductions of 50% or more are not uncommon.\\\\n* Reduced discovery expenses.\\\\u00a0 By placing the need for discovery in the full context of the case, litigants can better prioritize or even eliminate some of the most expensive discovery such as depositions.\\\\n* Improved ability of business units to make informed settle-or-litigate decisions. Improved ability to settle disputes creatively, such as through an exchange of goods or services.\\\\n* Increased ability to retain a business or professional relationship with the adversary since disputes are settled earlier, before positions get hardened and feelings rise.\\\\n* Improved ability to evaluate the performance of both inside and outside counsel. Increased ability to identify the causes of litigation and to take countermeasures to avoid similar claims.\\\\n\\\\nPerkins Coie would be pleased to work with you to implement or improve your approach to litigation management by assisting you to prepare litigation risk assessments for pending or future claims brought by or against you.\\\\n\\\\n[Home](/)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u00a9 2025\\\\n[Perkins Coie LLP](/)\\\\n\\\\n[Jump back to top](#main-content)\\\\n\\\\n",\\n    "metadata": {\\n      "content_elapsed": 1982.0,\\n      "readability_elapsed": 70.0,\\n      "markdown_elapsed": 3.0,\\n      "text_elapsed": null,\\n      "summarize_elapsed": null,\\n      "cached": null\\n    },\\n    "published_date": "1756449751.8667862"\\n  }\\n]\') </scrape-webpage> </tool_result>'}
