The website has successfully implemented many of the components we developed:\n\n## Key Components Successfully Implemented:\n\n1. **Comprehensive Framework Structure**\n   - The legal framework based on 28 U.S.C. §§ 455, 144 and key Supreme Court precedents\n   - Risk & probability analysis with quantitative methods\n   - Practical implementation guides with the 48-hour prejudice triage protocol\n\n2. **Interactive Risk Calculator**\n   - Web-based calculator for assessing prejudice factors\n   - Risk visualization through matrix display\n   - Recommendation generation based on risk levels\n\n3. **API & Integration**\n   - Comprehensive API with endpoints for assessments, factors, and results\n   - Integration guides for popular case management systems (Clio, Practice Panther, MyCase, etc.)\n   - Webhook implementation for real-time notifications\n\n4. **Documentation & Resources**\n   - Structured documentation covering all aspects of the framework\n   - Case studies demonstrating practical application\n   - Templates and worksheets for immediate implementation\n\n5. **Deployment Options**\n   - Docker-based deployment for simple installation\n   - Component downloads for individual needs\n   - GitHub repository access for developers\n\nThe website effectively communicates the value proposition of the Legal Prejudice Analysis Project and provides multiple pathways for users to engage with the framework, whether through documentation, downloads, or the interactive demo.\n\nWould you like me to help with any specific aspects of the website or provide suggestions for further enhancements?\n</ask>\n</function_calls>", 'tool_calls': None}
