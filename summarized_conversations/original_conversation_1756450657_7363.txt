The reason is clear: in a constitutional\\\\norder grounded in the rule of law, it is imperative that judges make decisions according to law, unclouded by personal bias or conflicts of interest. Accordingly,\\\\nupon ascending the bench, every federal judge takes an oath to \\\\u201cfaithfully and\\\\nimpartially discharge and perform all the duties\\\\u201d of judicial office. 1 Moreover, the\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment has been construed to guarantee litigants the right to a \\\\u201cneutral and detached,\\\\u201d or impartial, judge. Lastly,\\\\nin a democratic republic in which the legitimacy of government depends on the\\\\nconsent and approval of the governed, public confidence in the administration of\\\\njustice is indispensable. It is not enough that judges _be_ impartial; the public must\\\\n_perceive_ them to be so. The Code of Conduct for United States Judges therefore\\\\nadmonishes judges to \\\\u201cact at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary\\\\u201d and to \\\\u201cavoid impropriety\\\\nand the appearance of impropriety in all activities.\\\\u201d 3\\\\n\\\\nWhen the impartiality of a judge is in doubt, the appropriate remedy is to\\\\ndisqualify that judge from hearing further proceedings in the matter. In _Caperton_\\\\n_v. A.T. Massey Coal Co._ , 4 a case concerning disqualification of a state supreme\\\\ncourt justice, the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed that litigants have a due process\\\\nright to an impartial judge, and that under circumstances in which judicial bias\\\\nis probable, due process requires disqualification. The Court noted, however, that\\\\ndisqualification rules may be and often are more rigorous than the Due Process\\\\nClause requires. In the aftermath of _Caperton_ , the House Judiciary Committee\\\\nheld a hearing on the state of judicial disqualification in the federal system. 5\\\\nDisqualification requirements for federal judges require disqualification not just\\\\n\\\\n1. 28 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 453.

In common parlance, \\\\u201cdisqualification\\\\u201d and \\\\u201crecusal\\\\u201d are sometimes used interchangeably. Other times,\\\\nthe two terms are distinguished, with \\\\u201crecusal\\\\u201d referring to withdrawal on the\\\\njudge\\\\u2019s own initiative, and \\\\u201cdisqualification\\\\u201d meaning withdrawal on the motion\\\\nof a party. Applicable federal statutes\\\\u2014and the Code of Conduct for United States\\\\nJudges\\\\u2014however, use \\\\u201cdisqualification\\\\u201d broadly to embrace withdrawal both on\\\\nmotion and sua sponte. Because none of the primary sources of applicable law\\\\nunder study here refer to recusal, this monograph follows their lead.\\\\n\\\\n7\\\\nDisqualification has ethical and procedural dimensions. The ethical dimension is governed by Canon 3C of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges,\\\\nas construed by the Committee on Codes of Conduct of the Judicial Conference\\\\nof the United States. 8 Readers are encouraged to consult the Code of Conduct,\\\\nthe Published Advisory Opinions 9 of the committee, and the Compendium of\\\\nSelected Opinions of the committee.\\\\n\\\\nThe procedural dimension, in contrast, is governed by four sections in Title\\\\n28 of the U.S. Code: \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 47, 144, 455, and 2106. Although the text of Canon 3C on\\\\ndisqualification is substantially similar to 28 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 455, and both seek to promote\\\\npublic confidence in the judiciary, the focus of the two is different. Whereas the\\\\ngoal of the Code of Conduct\\\\u2014including Canon 3C\\\\u2014is to inform federal judges\\\\nof their ethical obligations, to the end of advising them on conduct, \\\\u00a7 455 is a\\\\nprocedural statute aimed at articulating disqualification standards, to the end of\\\\npreserving the rights of litigants to impartial justice. This monograph focuses on\\\\nthe procedural dimension of federal judicial disqualification through an analysis\\\\nof the applicable statutory law.\\\\n\\\\nThe two principal statutes governing judicial disqualification are 28 U.S.C.\\\\n\\\\u00a7 455, \\\\u201cDisqualification of justice, judge or magistrate judge\\\\u201d (discussed in section II), and 28 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 144, \\\\u201cBias or prejudice of judge\\\\u201d (discussed in section III).\\\\nThe relationship between the two has been a source of some confusion. Although\\\\nthe two sections provide overlapping remedies for bias, there are some important\\\\ndifferences. First, \\\\u00a7 144 aims exclusively at _actual_ bias or prejudice, whereas \\\\u00a7 455\\\\ndeals not only with actual bias and other forms of partiality but also with the\\\\n\\\\n6. 28 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 455(a).\\\\n7. _See_ appendix A for text of Canon 3C.\\\\n8. \\\\u201cThe Code of Conduct is the law with respect to the ethical obligations of federal judges.\\\\u201d\\\\n_United States v.

Cir. 2001).\\\\n\\\\n9. _Available at_ [http://www.uscourts.gov/rules-policies/judiciary-policies](http://www.uscourts.gov/rules-policies/judiciary-policies) .\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n_appearance_ of partiality. Second, \\\\u00a7 144 is triggered by a party\\\\u2019s affidavit, whereas\\\\n\\\\u00a7 455 may be invoked in a motion by a party or sua sponte by the judge. Third,\\\\n\\\\u00a7 144 applies only to district judges, while \\\\u00a7 455 covers \\\\u201c[a]ny justice, judge, or\\\\nmagistrate judge of the United States.\\\\u201d 10\\\\n\\\\nA third disqualification statute, 28 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 47 (discussed in section IV),\\\\nprovides that \\\\u201c[n]o judge shall hear or determine an appeal from the decision\\\\nof a case or issue tried by him.\\\\u201d The statute applies to judges sitting on courts of\\\\nappeals who were recently appointed from the district court or who are district\\\\njudges sitting by designation, and directs their disqualification from appeals of\\\\ncases they decided as trial judges. Given its limited applicability, this statute has\\\\nbeen utilized infrequently, and for the most part uneventfully.\\\\n\\\\nA fourth statute, 28 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 2106 (discussed in section V), is not a\\\\ndisqualification statute as such but has been used to serve a comparable purpose.\\\\nIt authorizes the Supreme Court and circuit courts to \\\\u201cremand the cause\\\\nand . . . require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the\\\\ncircumstances.\\\\u201d Section 2106 effectively enables an appellate court to disqualify a\\\\ndistrict judge by remanding a matter to a different judge for further proceedings\\\\nif the appellate court doubts the original judge\\\\u2019s impartiality.\\\\n\\\\n10. _See_ Pearson v. Prison Health Serv., 850 F.3d 526, 544 n.10 (3d Cir. 2017) (\\\\u201cThe District Court is\\\\nthus ultimately responsible for the decision, including for the Magistrate\\\\u2019s report and recommendation\\\\nif it is adopted in its entirety, but magistrate judges play an important role in the operation of the\\\\nfederal courts and must take care to word their published recommendations accordingly. Indeed, it is\\\\nequally applicable to District Judges and Magistrates that \\\\u2018[w]henever a judge\\\\u2019s impartiality \\\\u201cmight\\\\nreasonably be questioned\\\\u201d in a proceeding, 28 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 455(a) commands the judge to disqualify\\\\nhimself _sua sponte_ in that proceeding.\\\\u2019\\\\u201d).\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n#### Judicial Disqualification\\\\n\\\\n##### History and Policy\\\\n\\\\n###### A. History\\\\n\\\\nDisqualification standards in the United States have been a work in progress,\\\\ngaining in complexity and strength over time. In 1792, Congress enacted legislation that was the precursor to 28 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 455. This legislation codified the common law by calling for disqualification of a district judge who was \\\\u201cconcerned in\\\\ninterest\\\\u201d but added that a judge could also be disqualified if the judge \\\\u201chas been\\\\nof counsel for either party.\\\\u201d 11\\\\n12\\\\nThe statute was expanded in 1821 to require disqualification when relatives of the judge appeared as parties.\\\\n\\\\n13\\\\nIn 1891, Congress enacted legislation, later codified as 28 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 47, forbidding a judge from hearing the appeal of a case that the judge tried. In 1911,\\\\nthe precursor to \\\\u00a7 455 was further amended to require disqualification when the\\\\njudge was a material witness in the case. 14 That same year, Congress also enacted\\\\nlegislation\\\\u2014the predecessor to 28 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 144\\\\u2014entitling a party to secure the\\\\n\\\\n15\\\\ndisqualification of a judge by submitting an affidavit that the judge has \\\\u201ca personal bias or prejudice\\\\u201d against the affiant or for the opposing party. A decade later,\\\\nin _Berger v. United States_ , 16 the Supreme Court interpreted this statute to prohibit\\\\na judge from ruling on the truth of matters asserted in such an affidavit and to\\\\nrequire automatic disqualification if the affidavit was facially sufficient.\\\\n\\\\n11.

In _Tumey v. Ohio_ , the Court invalidated, on due process grounds, an\\\\nOhio statute that authorized a judge to preside over cases in which the judge would\\\\nreceive court costs assessed against convicted (but not acquitted) defendants.\\\\n\\\\nBy the mid-twentieth century, common-law aversion to judicial bias as\\\\ngrounds for disqualification continued to exert considerable influence. Section 455\\\\nremained silent as to bias. Section 144\\\\u2014although ostensibly enabling a party to\\\\ndisqualify a district judge simply by submitting an affidavit alleging personal\\\\nbias\\\\u2014had been construed exactingly by the courts of appeals. As Professor John\\\\n\\\\n18\\\\nFrank explained at the time, \\\\u201cnarrow construction of the phrase \\\\u2018bias and prejudice\\\\u2019\\\\u201d had allowed frequent evasion of the statute. Courts would find affidavits\\\\n\\\\u201cnot \\\\u2018legally sufficient\\\\u2019\\\\u201d because the \\\\u201cspecific acts mentioned\\\\u201d did not \\\\u201cindicate\\\\n\\\\u2018bias and prejudice,\\\\u2019\\\\u201d thereby \\\\u201cemasculat[ing] the _Berger_ decision by transferring\\\\nthe point of conflict.\\\\u201d 19 Frank warned that \\\\u201c[u]nless and until the Supreme Court\\\\ngives new force and effect to the _Berger_ decision, the disqualification practice of\\\\nthe federal district courts will remain sharply limited.\\\\u201d 20\\\\n\\\\nIn 1948, \\\\u00a7 455 was further amended to disqualify judges who were related to\\\\na party\\\\u2019s lawyer (not just related to a party, as had been the case since 1821). As\\\\namended, the statute then provided:\\\\n\\\\nAny justice or judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any\\\\ncase in which he has a substantial interest, has been of counsel, is or has,\\\\nbeen a material witness, or is so related to or connected with a party or his\\\\nattorney as to render it improper, in his opinion, for him to sit on the trial,\\\\nappeal, or other proceeding therein. 21\\\\n\\\\nIn 1964, the Fifth Circuit articulated a so-called duty to sit. 22 \\\\u201cIt is a judge\\\\u2019s\\\\nduty to refuse to sit when he is disqualified, but it is equally his duty to sit when\\\\nthere is no valid reason for recusation.\\\\u201d 23 In context, this created a duty to preside\\\\nnotwithstanding obvious appearance problems\\\\u2014problems that did not warrant\\\\ndisqualification under existing law. By 1972, Justice William Rehnquist reported,\\\\nin _Laird v. Tatum_ , 24 that the duty to sit had been accepted by all circuit courts.\\\\n\\\\n17. 273 U.S. 510 (1927).\\\\n18.

The Model Code sought to encapsulate the ethics of disqualification into\\\\na unified rule. 25 Under the new rule, a judge was subject to disqualification \\\\u201cin a\\\\nproceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including\\\\nbut not limited to\\\\u201d cases in which the judge had an actual bias concerning a party,\\\\nhad served as a lawyer in the matter (or was still with his former firm when the\\\\nmatter was being handled by another lawyer in that firm), had an interest in the\\\\ncase, or was related to the parties or their lawyers.\\\\n\\\\nIn 1973, the Judicial Conference of the United States adopted the Code of\\\\nConduct for United States Judges, based on the 1972 Model Code. The Code of\\\\nConduct applies to appellate and district judges, judges on the Courts of International Trade and Federal Claims, and bankruptcy and magistrate judges. The\\\\nJudicial Conference Committee on Codes of Conduct is authorized to render advisory opinions about the code when requested by a judge to whom the code applies.\\\\n\\\\nIn 1974, Congress adopted, with some variations, the Model Code\\\\u2019s disqualification rule in an amendment to \\\\u00a7 455, which\\\\u2014by virtue of its requirement\\\\nthat judges disqualify themselves whenever their impartiality might reasonably\\\\nbe questioned\\\\u2014was generally seen as qualifying, if not ending, the \\\\u201cduty to sit.\\\\u201d 26\\\\n\\\\n###### B. Policy\\\\n\\\\nThe history of judicial disqualification, discussed in the preceding section, reveals at least three policies at work, all of which are oriented toward preserving\\\\nand promoting an impartial judiciary. First is fair process. To guarantee litigants\\\\ntheir day in court before an impartial judge, we need a mechanism to disqualify\\\\njudges who may be biased against a party or otherwise closed-minded. This is, in\\\\neffect, the due process justification for disqualification\\\\u2014a means to protect the\\\\nrights of litigants to a fair hearing before an impartial judge. 27\\\\n\\\\n25. Model Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3C (Am. Bar Ass\\\\u2019n 1972).\\\\n26. _See_ Charles Gardner Geyh, James J. Alfini, Steven Lubet & Jeffrey M. Shaman, Judicial\\\\nConduct and Ethics \\\\u00a7 4.03 (5th ed. 2013).\\\\n\\\\n27. Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510, 535 (1927) (Due Process Clause guarantees parties \\\\u201cright to have\\\\nan impartial judge\\\\u201d); _In re_ Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136 (1955) (\\\\u201c[a] fair trial in a fair tribunal is a\\\\nbasic requirement of due process\\\\u201d). _See also_ Model Code of Judicial Conduct, Terminology (Am. Bar\\\\nAss\\\\u2019n 2007) (defining \\\\u201cimpartial\\\\u201d as the \\\\u201cabsence of bias or prejudice in favor of, or against, particular\\\\nparties or classes of parties, as well as maintenance of an open mind in considering issues that may\\\\ncome before a judge\\\\u201d).\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nSecond is court legitimacy. To reassure the general public that its courts can\\\\nbe trusted to administer justice impartially, we must exclude judges whose conduct calls their impartiality into question. This focus on public confidence is what\\\\nled lawmakers to amend \\\\u00a7 455 in 1974 to disqualify judges whose impartiality\\\\n\\\\u201cmight reasonably be questioned.\\\\u201d 28\\\\n\\\\nThird is civic virtue. Disqualification rules are embedded in the Code of Conduct for United States Judges as a means to promote ethical and virtuous judging\\\\nby exhorting judges to live up to the ideals of the judicial role and step aside when\\\\ntheir impartiality is in doubt. 29\\\\n\\\\nTaken in isolation, these three justifications for disqualification rules\\\\u2014fair\\\\nprocess, court legitimacy, and civic virtue\\\\u2014would seem to favor a robust disqualification regime. But there are three countervailing concerns to be weighed in the\\\\nbalance. First, an unduly rigorous system of disqualification could be counterproductive. If the goal is to promote public and litigant confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary, a system in which judges are forever being challenged and\\\\nremoved could engender the perception that the judiciary is awash with bias. So\\\\nthere is something to be said for disqualification rules establishing a meaningful\\\\nthreshold that must be met before the time-honored presumption of impartiality\\\\nis rebutted. Chief Justice Roberts made this point in his dissent in _Caperton v._\\\\n_A.T. Massey Coal Co._ 30 He argued that reading the Due Process Clause to require\\\\ndisqualification for probable bias \\\\u201cwill inevitably lead to an increase in allegations that judges are biased, however groundless those charges may be. The end\\\\nresult will do far more to erode public confidence in judicial impartiality than an\\\\nisolated failure to recuse in a particular case.\\\\u201d 31 The _Caperton_\\\\n\\\\n32\\\\nmajority was mindful of the Chief Justice\\\\u2019s concern but concluded that \\\\u201c[a]pplication of the constitutional standard implicated in this case will . . . be confined to rare instances.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nSecond, an unduly rigorous disqualification regime can put a strain on the\\\\njudicial workforce that jeopardizes the expeditious administration of justice.\\\\nTo the extent that justice delayed is justice denied, the need for meaningful\\\\n\\\\n28. \\\\u201cIf we are concerned, as most of us are with the need to shore up public confidence in our\\\\npublic institutions, we need to remove any scintilla of doubt that the public might have that that judge\\\\nwould be prejudiced in his decision. And that is why the criteria that we establish in S. 1886 is rather\\\\nstrict.\\\\u201d _Judicial Disqualification: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Improvements in Judicial Machinery_\\\\nof the S.

If disqualification is made too easy to obtain, litigants can exploit disqualification strategically, to remove judges who are unlikely\\\\nto be receptive to a party\\\\u2019s arguments on the merits, for reasons having little to do\\\\nwith the judges\\\\u2019 \\\\u201cimpartiality,\\\\u201d as properly understood. 34\\\\n\\\\nThese policy considerations are of limited relevance to the interpretation of\\\\nunambiguous rules requiring judges to disqualify themselves for clearly defined\\\\nconflicts of interest, such as when the judge owns stock in a corporate party or\\\\nthe judge\\\\u2019s daughter enters an appearance before the court as counsel of record.\\\\nBut they can play a role when the court is called on to decide whether a judge\\\\u2019s\\\\nimpartiality \\\\u201cmight reasonably be questioned.\\\\u201d This is particularly true in greyarea cases that present a novel set of facts, where these policy implications can help\\\\nstrike a balance that promotes the purposes served by a rigorous disqualification\\\\nregime without being so rigorous as to raise countervailing concerns.\\\\n\\\\n33. Canon 3A(2) of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges ( _see_ appendix A) provides that\\\\n\\\\u201cA judge should hear and decide matters assigned, unless disqualified.\\\\u201d Commentary accompanying\\\\na similar rule in the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct explains that \\\\u201cjudges must be available\\\\nto decide matters that come before the courts,\\\\u201d and that \\\\u201cunwarranted disqualification\\\\u201d is at odds\\\\nwith \\\\u201cthe judge\\\\u2019s respect for fulfillment of judicial duties, and a proper concern for the burdens that\\\\nmay be imposed upon the judge\\\\u2019s colleagues.\\\\u201d Model Code of Judicial Conduct r. 2.7, cmt.

Overview\\\\n\\\\n1. The text of \\\\u00a7 455\\\\n\\\\nThe primary source of disqualification law in the federal judicial system is\\\\n28 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 455. It provides, in its entirety, as follows:\\\\n\\\\n**\\\\u00a7 455. Disqualification of justice, judge, or magistrate judge**\\\\n\\\\n(a) Any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall\\\\n\\\\ndisqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality\\\\nmight reasonably be questioned.\\\\n\\\\n(b) He shall also disqualify himself in the following circumstances:\\\\n\\\\n(1) Where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party,\\\\n\\\\nor personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding;\\\\n\\\\n(2) Where in private practice he served as a lawyer in the matter\\\\n\\\\nin controversy, or a lawyer with whom he previously practiced\\\\nlaw served during such association as a lawyer concerning the\\\\nmatter, or the judge or such lawyer has been a material witness\\\\nconcerning it;\\\\n\\\\n(3) Where he has served in governmental employment and in\\\\n\\\\nsuch capacity participated as counsel, adviser or material witness concerning the proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case in controversy;\\\\n\\\\n(4) He knows that he, individually or as a fiduciary, or his spouse\\\\n\\\\nor minor child residing in his household, has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the\\\\nproceeding, or any other interest that could be substantially\\\\naffected by the outcome of the proceeding;\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n(5) He or his spouse, or a person within the third degree of rela\\\\u00ad\\\\n\\\\ntionship to either of them, or the spouse of such a person:\\\\n\\\\n(i) Is a party to the proceeding, or an officer, director, or\\\\n\\\\ntrustee of a party;\\\\n\\\\n(ii) Is acting as a lawyer in the proceeding;\\\\n\\\\n(iii) Is known by the judge to have an interest that could be\\\\n\\\\nsubstantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding;\\\\n\\\\n(iv) Is to the judge\\\\u2019s knowledge likely to be a material witness\\\\n\\\\nin the proceeding.\\\\n\\\\n(c) A judge should inform himself about his personal and fiduciary\\\\n\\\\nfinancial interests, and make a reasonable effort to inform himself\\\\nabout the personal financial interests of his spouse and minor children residing in his household.\\\\n\\\\n(d) For the purposes of this section the following words or phrases\\\\n\\\\nshall have the meaning indicated:\\\\n\\\\n(1) \\\\u201cproceeding\\\\u201d includes pretrial, trial, appellate review, or other\\\\n\\\\nstages of litigation;\\\\n\\\\n(2) the degree of relationship is calculated according to the civil\\\\n\\\\nlaw system;\\\\n\\\\n(3) \\\\u201cfiduciary\\\\u201d includes such relationships as executor, adminis\\\\u00ad\\\\n\\\\ntrator, trustee, and guardian;\\\\n\\\\n(4) \\\\u201cfinancial interest\\\\u201d means ownership of a legal or equitable in\\\\u00ad\\\\n\\\\nterest, however small, or a relationship as director, adviser, or\\\\nother active participant in the affairs of a party, except that:\\\\n\\\\n(i) Ownership in a mutual or common investment fund that\\\\n\\\\nholds securities is not a \\\\u201cfinancial interest\\\\u201d in such securities unless the judge participates in the management of\\\\nthe fund;\\\\n\\\\n(ii) An office in an educational, religious, charitable, frater\\\\u00ad\\\\n\\\\nnal, or civic organization is not a \\\\u201cfinancial interest\\\\u201d in\\\\nsecurities held by the organization;\\\\n\\\\n(iii) The proprietary interest of a policyholder in a mutual\\\\n\\\\ninsurance company, of a depositor in a mutual savings\\\\nassociation, or a similar proprietary interest, is a \\\\u201cfinancial interest\\\\u201d in the organization only if the outcome of\\\\nthe proceeding could substantially affect the value of the\\\\ninterest;\\\\n\\\\n(iv) Ownership of government securities is a \\\\u201cfinancial inter\\\\u00ad\\\\n\\\\nest\\\\u201d in the issuer only if the outcome of the proceeding\\\\ncould substantially affect the value of the securities.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n(e) No justice, judge, or magistrate judge shall accept from the parties\\\\n\\\\nto the proceeding a waiver of any ground for disqualification enumerated in subsection (b). Where the ground for disqualification\\\\narises only under subsection (a), waiver may be accepted provided\\\\nit is preceded by a full disclosure on the record of the basis for\\\\ndisqualification.\\\\n\\\\n(f) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, if any\\\\n\\\\njustice, judge, magistrate judge, or bankruptcy judge to whom a\\\\nmatter has been assigned would be disqualified, after substantial\\\\njudicial time has been devoted to the matter, because of the appearance or discovery, after the matter was assigned to him or her,\\\\nthat he or she individually or as a fiduciary, or his or her spouse\\\\nor minor child residing in his or her household, has a financial\\\\ninterest in a party (other than an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome), disqualification is not required if\\\\nthe justice, judge, magistrate judge, bankruptcy judge, spouse or\\\\nminor child, as the case may be, divests himself or herself of the\\\\ninterest that provides the grounds for the disqualification.\\\\n\\\\nSubsections (a) and (b) occupy the core of \\\\u00a7 455 and should be read together.\\\\nThe two subsections divide the universe of disqualification into two categories:\\\\nthe general catchall of \\\\u00a7 455(a), which requires disqualification from any proceeding in which a judge\\\\u2019s \\\\u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned\\\\u201d; and a\\\\nlist of more specific grounds for disqualification in \\\\u00a7 455(b).\\\\n\\\\nThe rest of \\\\u00a7 455 is directed at implementing subsections (a) and (b):\\\\n\\\\n-  Subsection (c) admonishes judges to keep abreast of their financial interests to ensure that they know when to disqualify themselves under\\\\n\\\\u00a7 455(b)(4).\\\\n\\\\n-  Subsection (d) defines the terms used in subsections (a) and (b).\\\\n\\\\n-  Subsection (e) provides parties with a limited opportunity to waive disqualification otherwise required by the catchall subsection (a), typically\\\\nwhere the judge is poised to disqualify himself or herself sua sponte. It\\\\ndoes not, however, permit the parties to waive disqualification required\\\\nby the more specific provisions of subsection (b).\\\\n\\\\n-  Subsection (f) provides a limited opportunity for judges to avoid the\\\\nneed to disqualify themselves for financial interest under subsection\\\\n(b)(4) through divestiture.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n2. Interpretive ground rules\\\\n\\\\na. Interpreting \\\\u00a7 455(a) in relation to \\\\u00a7 455(b)\\\\n\\\\nAs embodied in \\\\u00a7 455, subsections (a) and (b) are conceptually separate. Subsection (a) compels disqualification for the appearance of partiality, while subsection\\\\n(b) \\\\u201calso\\\\u201d compels disqualification for bias, financial interest, and other specific grounds. In contrast, the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct\\\\u2014after which\\\\n\\\\u00a7 455 was originally modeled\\\\u2014and the current Code of Conduct for United States\\\\nJudges unify the two halves conceptually by characterizing the specific grounds\\\\nfor disqualification in subsection (b) as a nonexclusive subset of circumstances in\\\\nwhich a judge\\\\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned in subsection (a). 35\\\\nIn other words, \\\\u00a7 455 says that judges must disqualify themselves under subsection (a) when their impartiality might reasonably be questioned _and_ when one\\\\nof the specific scenarios enumerated in subsection (b) applies. The ABA Model\\\\nCode, in contrast, declares that judges must disqualify themselves when their impartiality might reasonably be questioned, _which includes but is not limited to_ the\\\\nconflict-of-interest scenarios enumerated in subsection (b).\\\\n\\\\nFor the most part, this may be a distinction without a difference\\\\u2014disqualification is required if the specific or general provisions are triggered, regardless of\\\\nwhether the specific provisions are characterized as a subset of or separate from\\\\nthe general. On the other hand, by conceptualizing them separately, \\\\u00a7 455 can\\\\nrequire disqualification under specific circumstances enumerated in subsection\\\\n(b) that might not reasonably be characterized as calling a judge\\\\u2019s impartiality\\\\ninto question under subsection (a). For example, subsection (b)(4) requires judges to disqualify themselves for \\\\u201cfinancial interest\\\\u201d (defined in subsection (d) as\\\\n\\\\u201chowever small\\\\u201d)\\\\u2014which necessarily includes an interest so small that it could\\\\nnot reasonably call the judge\\\\u2019s impartiality into question. 36\\\\n\\\\nAny circumstance in which a judge\\\\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned under \\\\u00a7 455(a) requires disqualification, even if the circumstance is not\\\\nenumerated in \\\\u00a7 455(b). 37 At the same time, when \\\\u00a7 455(b) identifies a particular\\\\nsituation requiring disqualification, it will tend to control any \\\\u00a7 455(a) analysis with respect to that specific situation. For example, \\\\u00a7 455(b)(5) requires disqualification when one of the parties is within the third degree of relationship to\\\\nthe judge. Consequently, a fourth-degree relationship to a party does not _by itself_\\\\ncreate an appearance of partiality requiring disqualification under \\\\u00a7 455(a). As\\\\n\\\\n35. Model Code of Judicial Conduct r. 2.11(a) (Am. Bar Ass\\\\u2019n 2011); Canon 3C, Code of Conduct\\\\nfor United States Judges (2019).\\\\n\\\\n36. Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 860 n.8 (1988).\\\\n37. _Id._\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nthe Supreme Court explained, \\\\u201c[s]ection 455(b)(5), which addresses the matter\\\\nof relationship specifically, ends the disability at the _third_ degree of relationship,\\\\nand that should obviously govern for purposes of \\\\u00a7 455(a) as well.\\\\u201d 38 That said,\\\\ndisqualification under \\\\u00a7 455(a) might still be appropriate if, for example, the\\\\njudge\\\\u2019s personal relationship with the fourth-degree relative was so close as to call\\\\nthe judge\\\\u2019s impartiality into question. In that situation, disqualification would be\\\\nrequired not because the party is a remote blood relative of the judge but because\\\\nof the close personal relationship between the two. As a practical matter, however,\\\\nwhen a litigant seeks disqualification under both \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 455(a) and (b), and the court\\\\nis satisfied that disqualification is required under \\\\u00a7 455(a), it will frequently avoid\\\\n\\\\n39\\\\nthe complexities of interpreting the sections in relation to each other by concluding that it need not address the \\\\u00a7 455(b) claim.\\\\n\\\\nb. Balancing the duty to decide with the duty to disqualify\\\\n\\\\nPrior to 1974, the courts of appeals applied a judicial \\\\u201cgloss\\\\u201d to \\\\u00a7 455 that created a\\\\n\\\\u201cduty to sit,\\\\u201d 40 whereby judges resolved close questions against disqualification\\\\u2014\\\\nincluding cases in which a judge\\\\u2019s impartiality was in doubt, as long as an\\\\nenumerated conflict of interest requiring disqualification did not apply. The 1974\\\\namendments to \\\\u00a7 455, however, shifted the balance by requiring disqualification\\\\nwhenever a judge\\\\u2019s impartiality \\\\u201cmight\\\\u201d reasonably be questioned, and the\\\\nlegislative history made clear that in revising the statute, Congress sought to end\\\\nthe \\\\u201cduty to sit.\\\\u201d 41 The First, Fifth, Sixth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits have since\\\\nsaid that close questions should be decided in favor of disqualification, 42 while\\\\nthe Seventh Circuit has remarked that \\\\u201c[a] judge _may_ decide close calls in favor\\\\nof recusal.\\\\u201d 43 Justice Scalia, in declining a request for his own disqualification,\\\\ncited the proposition that judges should err on the side of disqualification with\\\\napparent approval as applied to the lower courts, but opined that the absence of\\\\n\\\\n38.

The Sixth Circuit held that \\\\u201c _Price Bros. v. Philadelphia Gear Corp._ _where a suit is to be tried without a jury,_ 58\\\\n\\\\n59\\\\nsending a law clerk to gather evidence is so destructive of the appearance of impartiality required of a presiding judge\\\\u201d that a remand was necessary to determine the truth of the allegation. The D.C. Circuit has stated that \\\\u201crecusal might\\\\nwell be prudent when a perjury bench trial involves testimony from a proceeding\\\\nover which the same judge presided,\\\\u201d although \\\\u00a7 455(a) \\\\u201cdoes not require it.\\\\u201d 60\\\\n\\\\nEven though disqualification issues may be of special concern in bench trials,\\\\nit does not follow that a different disqualification standard is justified in jury\\\\ntrials. As the Third Circuit has stated:\\\\n\\\\n[S]ection 455 properly makes no distinction between jury and nonjury\\\\ntrials. The district judge in a jury trial must still make numerous pretrial\\\\nrulings, including crucial summary judgment rulings, and will doubtless\\\\nbe called on to make numerous rulings on the qualification of witnesses\\\\nand on evidentiary matters, not to mention post-trial motions. 61\\\\n\\\\ne. Standing\\\\n\\\\nParties who file disqualification motions claim, in effect, that they will be aggrieved if their cases are decided by judges who are partial or appear to be so.\\\\nIn the usual case, a movant alleges that the judge has a real or perceived bias or\\\\ninterest against the movant or in favor of the movant\\\\u2019s opponent. For example, a\\\\nplaintiff may seek to disqualify a judge on the grounds that the defendant is the\\\\njudge\\\\u2019s close friend. In that scenario, however, may the judge\\\\u2019s friend likewise\\\\nmove for disqualification? Although it might seem that the friend lacks standing,\\\\ninsofar as the friend stands to be helped rather than injured by the allegedly disqualifying bias, the friend could harbor an understandable concern that the judge\\\\nmight err in favor of his friend\\\\u2019s opponent to appear fair.\\\\n\\\\nDoes a party have standing to challenge a refusal to disqualify when the\\\\njudge\\\\u2019s alleged partiality would be in that party\\\\u2019s favor? In _Pashaian v. Eccelston_\\\\n_Properties, Ltd._ , 62 the judge\\\\u2019s sister-in-law was married to a partner in the law firm\\\\nof a defendant\\\\u2019s attorney. Even though any potential bias would seem to favor the\\\\ndefendants, multiple defendants moved to disqualify the judge, who granted the\\\\nmotion, but not before ordering a preliminary injunction in favor of the plaintiff.\\\\n\\\\n58. 629 F.2d 444 (6th Cir. 1980).\\\\n59. _Id._ at 446 (emphasis added) (finding harmless error on remand, 649 F.2d 416 (6th Cir. 1981)).\\\\n60.

Such a party might\\\\nlegitimately be concerned that the judge will \\\\u201cbend over backwards\\\\u201d to\\\\navoid any appearance of partiality, thereby inadvertently favoring the opposing party. The possibility of this compensatory bias by an interested\\\\n\\\\n63\\\\njudge is sufficiently immediate to constitute the \\\\u201cpersonal injury\\\\u201d necessary to confer standing under Article III.\\\\n\\\\nA different standing issue has arisen with respect to nonparty witnesses who\\\\nseek a judge\\\\u2019s disqualification. In _United States v. Sciarra_ , 64 the Third Circuit\\\\nconcluded that nonparty witnesses lacked standing to seek the disqualification of\\\\na judge in the context of a posttrial investigation. In that case, the United States\\\\ngovernment filed a civil complaint against a local union and twelve individuals,\\\\nincluding the two petitioners who were members of the union\\\\u2019s executive\\\\nboard. After holding a bench trial, the district judge found the executive board\\\\nculpable of aiding and abetting corruption. After the trial court\\\\u2019s judgment was\\\\naffirmed on appeal, the government moved to depose the petitioners about the\\\\nunion\\\\u2019s operations during the intervening period. 65 The petitioners, who had\\\\nbeen removed from their executive board positions as part of the trial court\\\\u2019s\\\\nfinal judgment, filed a cross-motion to disqualify the presiding judge. The judge\\\\ndeclined to disqualify himself. In reviewing that decision, the Third Circuit\\\\nconstrued \\\\u00a7 455(a)\\\\u2019s \\\\u201cproceeding\\\\u201d requirement to mean any stage of litigation\\\\nin which a judge\\\\u2019s decision affects the \\\\u201csubstantive rights of litigants to an actual\\\\ncase or controversy.\\\\u201d 66 Because there was no pending action in which the rights of\\\\nthe litigants were at issue, the petitioners had no standing, as nonparty witnesses,\\\\nto invoke \\\\u00a7 455 to disqualify the judge. The Third Circuit reserved judgment on\\\\nthe question whether, in the context of a case or controversy, a nonparty witness\\\\ncan move for the disqualification of a judge. 67\\\\n\\\\n63. _Id._ at 83. _See also_ United States v.

Grounds for disqualification\\\\n\\\\n1. General standard: when impartiality might reasonably\\\\n\\\\nbe questioned\\\\u2014\\\\u00a7 455(a)\\\\n\\\\na. Framework for analysis\\\\n\\\\nSection 455(a) requires disqualification for the _appearance_ of partiality (i.e., when a\\\\njudge\\\\u2019s \\\\u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned\\\\u201d). Unlike \\\\u00a7 455(b)(1)\\\\u2014which\\\\nrequires disqualification for _actual_ partiality (i.e., when a judge \\\\u201chas a personal\\\\nbias or prejudice toward a party\\\\u201d)\\\\u2014whether the judge is, in fact, impartial is not\\\\ndispositive of disqualification under subsection (a). The justification for making perceived partiality a ground for disqualification is at least twofold. First, regardless of whether judges are partial in fact, public perceptions of partiality can\\\\nundermine confidence in the courts. Second, disqualifying judges for outward\\\\nmanifestations of what could reasonably be construed as bias obviates the need\\\\nto make subjective judgment calls about what is actually going on inside a judge\\\\u2019s\\\\nheart and mind.\\\\n\\\\nSection 455(a) makes clear that judges should apply an objective standard\\\\nin determining whether to disqualify. Judges contemplating disqualification\\\\nunder \\\\u00a7 455(a), then, should not ask whether they believe they are capable of\\\\nimpartially presiding over the case. Rather, the question is whether a judge\\\\u2019s\\\\nimpartiality might be questioned from the perspective of a reasonable person.\\\\nEvery circuit has adopted some version of the \\\\u201creasonable person\\\\u201d standard to\\\\nanswer this question. 68 In the context of denying a motion for his disqualification\\\\nfrom _Cheney v. United States District Court for the District of Columbia_ , 69 Justice\\\\nScalia noted that this reasonable person is aware \\\\u201c _of all the surrounding facts and_\\\\n_circumstances_ .\\\\u201d 70 The Second Circuit has characterized the reasonable person\\\\nas an \\\\u201cobjective, disinterested observer\\\\u201d who is privy to full knowledge of the\\\\n\\\\n68. _See, e.g._ , _In re_ United States, 666 F.2d 690, 695 (1st Cir. 1981); SEC v.

The Fourth Circuit has clarified that the hypothetical reasonable observer is not a judge because judges, keenly aware of the obligation to decide matters impartially, \\\\u201cmay regard asserted conflicts to be more 71\\\\ninnocuous than an outsider would.\\\\u201d 72 The Seventh Circuit has likewise noted that\\\\n\\\\n73\\\\nan outside observer is \\\\u201cless inclined to credit judges\\\\u2019 impartiality and mental discipline than the judiciary.\\\\u201d And relying on the Supreme Court\\\\u2019s observation in\\\\n_Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp._ , 74 the Fifth Circuit commented that\\\\n\\\\u201c[p]eople who have not served on the bench are often all too willing to indulge\\\\nsuspicions and doubts concerning the integrity of judges.\\\\u201d 75\\\\n\\\\nAt the same time, this hypothetical \\\\u201creasonable\\\\u201d observer \\\\u201cis not a person\\\\nunduly suspicious or concerned about a trivial risk that a judge may be biased.\\\\u201d 76\\\\nThe reasonable observer must be \\\\u201cthoughtful\\\\u201d and \\\\u201cwell-informed.\\\\u201d 77 The First\\\\nCircuit has emphasized that a reasonable person does not draw conclusions on\\\\nthe basis of groundless suspicion:\\\\n\\\\n[W]hen considering disqualification, the district court is _not_ to use the\\\\nstandard of \\\\u201cCaesar\\\\u2019s wife,\\\\u201d the standard of mere suspicion. That is because the disqualification decision must reflect the need to secure public confidence through proceedings that appear impartial, _not only_ _but_\\\\n_also_ the need to prevent parties from too easily obtaining the disqualification of a judge, thereby potentially manipulating the system for strategic\\\\nreasons, perhaps to obtain a judge more to their liking. 78\\\\n\\\\nNumerous cases have rejected disqualification under circumstances in which\\\\ncalling a judge\\\\u2019s impartiality into question would require suspicion or speculation\\\\nbeyond what a reasonable person would indulge.

The\\\\njudge subsequently reversed his earlier ruling, and the defendant argued that the\\\\njudge should have disqualified himself. Although it was widely speculated that\\\\nthe judge had reversed his earlier ruling in response to the threats and criticism,\\\\nthe Second Circuit concluded that disqualification was unnecessary. The need\\\\nfor disqualification \\\\u201cis to be determined \\\\u2018not by considering what a straw poll of\\\\nthe only partly informed man-in-the-street would show[,] but by examining the\\\\nrecord facts and the law, and then deciding whether a reasonable person knowing\\\\nand understanding all the relevant facts would recuse the judge.\\\\u2019\\\\u201d 81\\\\n\\\\nExplaining his decision not to disqualify himself in _Cheney_ , Justice Scalia\\\\nrejected the assertion that newspaper editorials calling his impartiality into\\\\nquestion were dispositive. The reasonable observer must be \\\\u201c _informed of all the_\\\\n_surrounding facts and circumstances_ ,\\\\u201d 82 and, in Scalia\\\\u2019s view, the editorials in\\\\n\\\\n83\\\\nquestion were not only factually inaccurate, but lacked recognition and understanding of relevant precedent.\\\\n\\\\nSection 455 also requires disqualification if a reasonable person might believe\\\\nthat the judge was aware of circumstances creating an appearance of partiality,\\\\neven if the judge was in fact unaware. In _Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition_\\\\n_Corp._ , 84 the trial judge was a member of the board of trustees of a university that\\\\nhad a financial interest in litigation before the judge. But the judge stated that he\\\\nwas unaware of the financial interest when he conducted a bench trial and ruled\\\\nin the case. The court of appeals, nevertheless, vacated the judgment under Fed.\\\\nR. Civ. P. 60(b) because the judge failed to disqualify himself pursuant to \\\\u00a7 455(a).\\\\nThe Supreme Court agreed.

Judge\\\\u2019s prior relationship with parties, witnesses,\\\\nor lawyers\\\\n\\\\n_Prior relationship with a party._ The First Circuit has observed that \\\\u201c[f]ormer affiliations with a party may persuade a judge not to sit; but they are rarely a basis for\\\\ncompelled [disqualification].\\\\u201d 89 Judges often cannot avoid some acquaintance with\\\\nthe underlying parties or events that give rise to litigation, particularly in smaller\\\\ncommunities. Acquaintance, by itself, will not require disqualification. The Second\\\\nCircuit upheld a refusal to disqualify where the judge had a social relationship with\\\\na shareholder in a company victimized by the defendants. The judge\\\\u2019s relationship\\\\nwith the shareholder \\\\u201cended seven or eight years prior to sentencing[,] . . . he had\\\\nno specific knowledge of the contested facts[,] and . . . the . . . allegations [regarding the judge\\\\u2019s friend\\\\u2019s restaurant] were not outcome-determinative in these\\\\nproceedings.\\\\u201d 90 The Second Circuit also upheld a refusal to disqualify where the\\\\ndefendant had a remote (but adversarial) business relationship with the judge\\\\u2019s\\\\nhusband. \\\\u201c[I]t requires too much speculation to convert [the husband\\\\u2019s] alleged\\\\n\\\\n91\\\\npast frustrated dealings with [the defendant] into any interest, financial or otherwise, in the outcome of [the defendant\\\\u2019s] unrelated criminal trial.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThe Eleventh Circuit rejected the argument that a judge\\\\u2019s penchant for strip\\\\nclubs required him to disqualify himself from a case in which a strip club was a\\\\nparty. In so ruling, the court emphasized that the judge did not frequent the club\\\\nin question. 92 In a related vein, the D.C. Circuit ruled that disqualification was\\\\nunnecessary where the judge and a party shared an interest in glass art and were\\\\nco-donors (with others) of a glass sculpture to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 93\\\\n\\\\nSome personal relationships, however, are so friendly or antagonistic as to\\\\nrequire disqualification. The Sixth Circuit reversed a failure to disqualify in a\\\\nsex discrimination suit where, in pretrial proceedings, the judge stated that he\\\\npersonally knew one of the people accused of discrimination and that \\\\u201che is an\\\\nhonorable man and I know he would never intentionally discriminate against\\\\nanybody.\\\\u201d 94 \\\\u201cOnce the district court expressed his ardent sentiments . . . the\\\\nobjective appearance of impartiality vanished.\\\\u201d 95 Similarly, the Second Circuit\\\\n\\\\n89. _In re_ Martinez-Catala, 129 F.3d 213, 221 (1st Cir. 1997).\\\\n90.

Both the judge and his cousin \\\\u201cdescribe[d] their\\\\nrelationship as more like that of \\\\u2018brother and sister\\\\u2019; she is the godmother to one\\\\nof his children.\\\\u201d 98\\\\n\\\\nIn another Fifth Circuit case, the court reversed a failure to disqualify where\\\\nthere was a publicized history of \\\\u201cbad blood\\\\u201d between the defendant and a close\\\\npersonal friend of the judge. 99 While noting that friendship between the judge and\\\\na person with an interest in the case need not be disqualifying, here the judge\\\\u2019s\\\\nfriend and the defendant \\\\u201cwere embroiled in a series of vindictive legal actions\\\\nresulting in a great deal of publicity,\\\\u201d some of which involved the judge\\\\u2019s spouse. 100\\\\n\\\\nA recurring issue has arisen with respect to litigants who stand accused of\\\\nthreatening, attacking, or killing federal judges. The cases are in general accord\\\\nthat if the presiding judge is among those targeted by the alleged assailant,\\\\ndisqualification is appropriate under \\\\u00a7 455(a). Thus, where the alleged assailant\\\\ntargeted a courthouse (rather than an individual judge) the Seventh Circuit\\\\ndetermined that all judges presiding in the circuit where the courthouse was\\\\nsituated at the time of the attack should disqualify themselves. 101 Likewise, where\\\\nthe alleged assailant targeted judges within the circuit generally, the Eleventh\\\\nCircuit decided that all judges presiding in the circuit when the attack occurred\\\\nwould disqualify themselves. 102\\\\n\\\\nOn the other hand, when the assigned judge is not among those targeted, disqualification may be unnecessary. A defendant was accused of threatening three\\\\nCalifornia district judges who handled his pro se cases.

Shared religious affiliation, for\\\\nexample, is insufficient to justify disqualification. In _Bryce v. Episcopal Church in_\\\\n_the Diocese of Colorado_ the Tenth Circuit rejected the assertion that disqualification was necessary simply because the judge was a member of the same religion , 105\\\\nas the defendants. The court found that the plaintiff\\\\u2019s argument that the judge\\\\u2019s\\\\nsubscription to the same belief system as the defendant was tenuous and mere\\\\n\\\\u201cassociational bias,\\\\u201d rendering it insufficient to necessitate disqualification. 106\\\\n\\\\n107\\\\nLikewise, shared political affiliation is not enough, by itself, to require disqualification. In the Tenth Circuit rejected the plaintiff\\\\u2019s argument that disqualification was necessary because the judge and a litigant _Higganbotham v. Oklahoma_ ,\\\\nshared a partisan affiliation in a politically charged case. The court explained, \\\\u201can\\\\ninescapable part of our system of government [is] that judges are drawn primarily\\\\nfrom lawyers who have participated in public and political affairs.\\\\u201d 108\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, a judge\\\\u2019s sexual orientation is not enough to disqualify a judge from\\\\nhearing cases in which a party is advocating in support of rights that could inure\\\\nto the benefit of people who share the judge\\\\u2019s orientation. The Ninth Circuit held\\\\nthat a district judge was not disqualified from ruling on the constitutionality of a\\\\nstate ban on same-sex marriage simply because he was in a long-term, same-sex\\\\nrelationship (the Supreme Court, however, subsequently vacated the decision on\\\\nthe grounds that the plaintiff lacked standing). 109\\\\n\\\\n103.

In _MacDraw, Inc. v. CIT Group_\\\\n_Equipment Financing, Inc_ ., 110 a defendant moved for an Asian judge to disqualify\\\\nhimself because the defendant had been publicly critical of a prominent Asian\\\\nman. The Second Circuit opined that \\\\u201cit is intolerable for a litigant, without any\\\\nfactual basis, to suggest that a judge cannot be impartial because of his or her\\\\nrace and political background.\\\\u201d 111\\\\n\\\\nIn a district court case where the judge\\\\u2019s impartiality was challenged because\\\\nof her gender, the judge denied the motion for disqualification.\\\\n\\\\nThe assertion, without more, that a judge who . . . happens to be of the\\\\nsame sex as a plaintiff in a suit alleging sex discrimination on the part of\\\\na law firm, is, therefore, so biased that he or she could not hear the case,\\\\ncomes nowhere near the standards required for [recusation]. Indeed, if\\\\nbackground or sex or race of each judge were, by definition, sufficient\\\\ngrounds for removal, no judge on this court could hear this case. 112\\\\n\\\\nThere is authority for declining to disqualify when the judge\\\\u2019s friend is a\\\\npublic official who is sued in an official (as opposed to a personal) capacity. In\\\\n_Cheney v. United States District Court for the District of Columbia_ , 113 Justice Scalia\\\\ndeclined to disqualify himself from hearing a case in which Vice President Dick\\\\nCheney was a named party after Justice Scalia went on a hunting trip with the\\\\nvice president while the case was pending before the Supreme Court. Justice\\\\nScalia emphasized that the suit in question was filed against the vice president\\\\nin his official, as distinguished from his personal, capacity, and explained the\\\\nimportance of that distinction:\\\\n\\\\n[W]hile friendship is a ground for recusal of a Justice where the personal\\\\nfortune or the personal freedom of the friend is at issue, it has traditionally _not_ been a ground for recusal where _official action_ is at issue, no matter\\\\nhow important the official action was to the ambitions or the reputation\\\\nof the Government officer. 114\\\\n\\\\nOn the other hand, there may be circumstances in which the ties between\\\\nthe judge and the public official are so close, and the consequences of a ruling\\\\nadverse to the official are so dire, that disqualification is appropriate regardless\\\\nof the capacity (if any) in which the official is sued. In _United States v. Bobo_ , 115\\\\nan Alabama district judge disqualified himself from hearing a case of interest\\\\n\\\\n110. 157 F.3d 956 (2d Cir. 1998).\\\\n111. _Id._ at 963.\\\\n112. Blank v.

Although the governor was not a party in\\\\nthe case, the outcome of the case could have affected the governor\\\\u2019s reelection.\\\\nTo avoid an appearance of bias, the district court concluded that disqualification\\\\nwas appropriate.\\\\n\\\\n_Prior relationship with a witness._ As with parties, a judge\\\\u2019s mere acquaintance or\\\\nfamiliarity with a witness does not require disqualification. In _Fletcher v. Conoco_\\\\n_Pipe Line Co._ , 116 the Eighth Circuit found disqualification unnecessary even though\\\\nthe judge maintained a thirty-six-year friendship with a fact witness for the\\\\nplaintiff and remained a client of the witness\\\\u2019s law firm in an unrelated, ongoing\\\\nmatter. The court found this relationship insufficient to overcome a presumption of\\\\nimpartiality. In _In re Beyond Innovation Technology Co._ , 117 the Federal Circuit ruled,\\\\nin the context of a mandamus action, that the movant \\\\u201chad not met its burden of\\\\nshowing that the judge clearly abused his discretion in not disqualifying\\\\u201d 118 when a\\\\nclose personal friend of the judge testified as a witness. The court emphasized that\\\\n\\\\u201cwe are not reviewing the matter de novo. We do not review to determine whether\\\\nwe would recuse in such circumstances. Instead, we are only to review whether the\\\\njudge abused his discretion in declining to disqualify himself.\\\\u201d 119\\\\n\\\\nOn the other hand, in some cases disqualification may be necessary. In\\\\n_United States v. Kelly_ , 120 the Eleventh Circuit held that a trial judge improperly\\\\nfailed to disqualify himself when, among other things, a close personal friend was\\\\na key defense witness. The judge had expressed concern on the record that he\\\\nmight \\\\u201cbend over backwards to prove he lacked favoritism\\\\u201d toward the witness,\\\\nand that a guilty verdict might \\\\u201cjeopardize his wife\\\\u2019s friendship\\\\u201d with the witness\\\\u2019s\\\\nwife. 121 These \\\\u201cprofound doubts about the propriety of continuing . . . on the case\\\\n. . . should have been resolved in favor of disqualification.\\\\u201d 122\\\\n\\\\n_Prior relationship with an attorney._ While a judge\\\\u2019s acquaintance with one of the\\\\nattorneys does not ordinarily require disqualification, there are cases where the\\\\nextent of intimacy, or other circumstances, renders disqualification necessary.\\\\nIn _United States v. Murphy_ , 123 the Seventh Circuit concluded that a judge should\\\\nhave disqualified himself where he and the prosecuting attorney were close\\\\n\\\\n116. 323 F.3d 661 (8th Cir. 2003).\\\\n117. 166 F.

The court\\\\nnoted that \\\\u201cfriendships among judges and lawyers are common\\\\u201d and \\\\u201ca judge\\\\nneed not disqualify himself just because a friend\\\\u2014even a close friend\\\\u2014appears\\\\nas a lawyer.\\\\u201d 124 Yet here the extent of intimacy was \\\\u201cunusual,\\\\u201d and an objective\\\\nobserver might reasonably doubt the judge\\\\u2019s impartiality where the judge \\\\u201cwas\\\\nsuch a close friend of the prosecutor that the families of both were just about to\\\\ntake a joint vacation.\\\\u201d 125\\\\n\\\\nBy the same token, a judge\\\\u2019s antipathy toward a lawyer is not enough, by itself,\\\\nto require disqualification, unless it casts doubt on the judge\\\\u2019s impartiality toward\\\\nthe lawyer\\\\u2019s client. As the Tenth Circuit opined in _United States v. Ritter_ , 126 \\\\u201cbias\\\\nin favor of or against an attorney can certainly result in bias toward the party.\\\\nThus, if a judge is biased in favor of an attorney, his impartiality might reasonably\\\\nbe questioned in relationship to the party.\\\\u201d 127 Even then, however, circumstances\\\\ncan change. In _Diversified Numismatics, Inc. v. City of Orlando_ , 128 the district judge\\\\nhad previously disqualified himself from prior cases \\\\u201cbecause of his feeling that\\\\nhe might be biased against counsel.\\\\u201d 129 When the judge declined to disqualify\\\\nhimself from a later case in which the attorney entered an appearance, the\\\\nEleventh Circuit affirmed the ruling: \\\\u201cTempers do cool, and anger does dissipate.\\\\nPrior recusals, without more, do not objectively demonstrate an appearance of\\\\npartiality.\\\\u201d 130\\\\n\\\\nThe Eleventh Circuit held that a trial judge should have disqualified himself\\\\nwhere his law clerk\\\\u2019s father\\\\u2014who himself had been the judge\\\\u2019s law clerk\\\\u2014was a\\\\npartner in the law firm representing one of the parties. 131 The",\\n    "metadata": {\\n      "content_elapsed": 3434.0,\\n      "readability_elapsed": null,\\n      "markdown_elapsed": 17894.0,\\n      "text_elapsed": null,\\n      "summarize_elapsed": null,\\n      "cached": null\\n    },\\n    "published_date": "1756449666.221259"\\n  }\\n]\') </scrape-webpage> </tool_result>'}
