{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '# Setting Up SSL for Your GitHub Pages Custom Domain\n\nI\'ll guide you through setting up SSL (HTTPS) for your custom domain on GitHub Pages. The good news is that GitHub Pages provides free and automatic SSL certificates for custom domains.\n\n## Automatic SSL with GitHub Pages\n\nGitHub Pages automatically secures custom domains with SSL certificates from Let\'s Encrypt. Here\'s how to ensure it\'s properly set up:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Your Custom Domain is Configured\n\n1. Go to your GitHub repository\n2. Click on "Settings"\n3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section\n4. Confirm your custom domain (`legal-prejudice-analysis.com`) is entered in the "Custom domain" field\n5. Make sure the CNAME file exists in your docs directory (we\'ve already created this)\n\n### Step 2: Enable "Enforce HTTPS"\n\n1. In the same GitHub Pages settings section\n2. Look for the "Enforce HTTPS" checkbox\n3. Check this box to enable HTTPS for your site\n\n**Note:** If the "Enforce HTTPS" checkbox is grayed out, it means one of the following:\n- GitHub is still provisioning your certificate (can take up to 24 hours)\n- There might be an issue with your DNS configuration\n\n### Step 3: Wait for Certificate Provisioning\n\n- GitHub needs time to provision your SSL certificate\n- This process typically takes a few hours but can take up to 24 hours\n- You\'ll know it\'s complete when the "Enforce HTTPS" option becomes available\n\n## Verifying Your DNS Configuration\n\nFor SSL to work properly, your DNS configuration must be correct. Let\'s make sure it\'s set up properly:\n\n### For Apex Domain (legal-prejudice-analysis.com)\n\nEnsure you have these A records pointing to GitHub Pages\' IP addresses:\n\n```\nA    @    185.199.108.153\nA    @    185.199.109.153\nA    @    185.199.110.153\nA    @    185.199.111.153\n```\n\n### For WWW Subdomain (www.legal-prejudice-analysis.com)\n\nEnsure you have this CNAME record:\n\n```\nCNAME    www    yourusername.github.io.\n```\n(Replace "yourusername" with your actual GitHub username)\n\n## Troubleshooting SSL Issues\n\nIf you encounter issues with SSL setup:\n\n### 1. Check for DNS Propagation\n\nDNS changes can take time to propagate. You can verify your DNS configuration using:\n\n```bash\ndig legal-prejudice-analysis.com +noall +answer\ndig www.legal-prejudice-analysis.com +noall +answer\n```\n\n### 2. Verify CNAME File\n\nEnsure your CNAME file in the docs directory contains only your domain name:\n\n```\nlegal-prejudice-analysis.com\n```\n\nNo additional text, whitespace, or line breaks should be present.\n\n### 3. Check for CAA Records\n\nIf your domain has CAA (Certificate Authority Authorization) records, ensure they allow Let\'s Encrypt to issue certificates:\n\n```\nCAA 0 issue "letsencrypt.org"\n```\n\n### 4. Wait 24 Hours\n\nSometimes it just takes time. If everything is configured correctly, wait up to 24 hours for GitHub to provision your certificate.\n\n## Testing Your SSL Configuration\n\nOnce SSL is set up, you can verify it\'s working properly:\n\n1. Visit `https://legal-prejudice-analysis.com` (note the https)\n2. Check for the padlock icon in your browser\'s address bar\n3. You can also use SSL checking tools like [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) to verify your configuration\n\n## Additional SSL Best Practices\n\n1. **Update Internal Links**: Ensure all internal links in your site use HTTPS or relative paths\n2. **Update External References**: If you reference external resources (images, scripts, etc.), use HTTPS URLs\n3. **Set Up Redirects**: Consider redirecting HTTP to HTTPS for better security\n\n## Monitoring SSL Certificate\n\nGitHub automatically renews your SSL certificate, but it\'s good practice to:\n\n1. Periodically check your site\'s SSL status\n2. Set a reminder to verify the certificate a month before its expiration (Let\'s Encrypt certificates typically last 90 days)\n\nLet me know if you encounter any specific issues with your SSL setup, and I can provide more targeted troubleshooting assistance.\n\n<function_calls>\n<ask>\n# Setting Up SSL for Your GitHub Pages Custom Domain\n\nGood news! GitHub Pages provides free and automatic SSL certificates for custom domains. Here\'s how to set it up:\n\n## Enable HTTPS in GitHub Pages Settings\n\n1. Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Pages\n2. Make sure your custom domain is properly configured\n3. Check the "Enforce HTTPS" checkbox\n4. If the checkbox is grayed out, GitHub is still provisioning your certificate (can take up to 24 hours)\n\n## Verify Your DNS Configuration\n\nFor SSL to work properly, ensure your DNS has:\n\n- **A records** for apex domain pointing to GitHub Pages IPs:\n  ```\n  A    @    185.199.108.153\n  A    @    185.199.109.153\n  A    @    185.199.110.153\n  A    @    185.199.111.153\n  ```\n\n- **CNAME record** for www subdomain:\n  ```\n  CNAME    www    yourusername.github.io.\n  ```\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n\n- **DNS Propagation**: Changes can take up to 48 hours to fully propagate\n- **CNAME File**: Ensure it contains only your domain name with no extra text\n- **Certificate Provisioning**: Allow up to 24 hours for GitHub to provision your certificate\n- **CAA Records**: If you use them, ensure they allow Let\'s Encrypt\n\nOnce everything is configured correctly, your site will automatically be served over HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate that GitHub manages and renews for you.\n\nWould you like me to help with any specific SSL configuration issues?\n</ask>\n</function_calls>', 'tool_calls': None}
