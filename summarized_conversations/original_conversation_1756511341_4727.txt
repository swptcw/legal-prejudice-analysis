{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '# Setting Up SSL Without Terminal Access\n\nI understand you don\'t have terminal access for the commands I mentioned. No problem! You can still set up SSL for your GitHub Pages custom domain entirely through web interfaces. Let me provide an alternative approach:\n\n## Setting Up SSL Through Web Interfaces\n\n### 1. Configure GitHub Pages Settings\n\n1. **Go to your GitHub repository** in your web browser\n2. **Click on "Settings"** (tab near the top of the repository)\n3. **Scroll down to "GitHub Pages"** section\n4. **Verify your custom domain** is entered correctly as `legal-prejudice-analysis.com`\n5. **Check the "Enforce HTTPS"** checkbox if it\'s available\n   - If it\'s grayed out, GitHub is still provisioning your certificate (wait up to 24 hours)\n\n### 2. Configure DNS Through Your Domain Registrar\'s Website\n\n1. **Log in to your domain registrar\'s website** (where you purchased `legal-prejudice-analysis.com`)\n   - Common registrars include GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.\n\n2. **Find the DNS management section** (often called "DNS Settings," "DNS Management," or "Name Servers")\n\n3. **Add A records** for your apex domain:\n   - Type: A\n   - Host/Name: @ (or leave blank, depending on your registrar)\n   - Value/Points to: 185.199.108.153\n   - TTL: Auto or 3600\n\n   Repeat this process to add all four GitHub Pages IP addresses:\n   - 185.199.108.153\n   - 185.199.109.153\n   - 185.199.110.153\n   - 185.199.111.153\n\n4. **Add CNAME record** for the www subdomain:\n   - Type: CNAME\n   - Host/Name: www\n   - Value/Points to: yourusername.github.io. (replace with your GitHub username)\n   - TTL: Auto or 3600\n\n### 3. Verify DNS Configuration Through Online Tools\n\nSince you don\'t have terminal access, you can use online DNS lookup tools to verify your configuration:\n\n1. Visit [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org/) or [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx)\n2. Enter your domain name (`legal-prejudice-analysis.com`)\n3. Check that the A records point to GitHub Pages IP addresses\n4. Repeat for `www.legal-prejudice-analysis.com` to verify the CNAME record\n\n### 4. Check SSL Certificate Status\n\nAfter waiting for DNS propagation and certificate provisioning (up to 24 hours):\n\n1. Visit your site using HTTPS: `https://legal-prejudice-analysis.com`\n2. Look for the padlock icon in your browser\'s address bar\n3. You can also use [SSL Checker](https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html) to verify your certificate\n\n## Common Issues and Solutions\n\n### If "Enforce HTTPS" is Grayed Out:\n\n1. **Wait longer**: Certificate provisioning can take up to 24 hours\n2. **Verify DNS settings** through the online tools mentioned above\n3. **Check for typos** in your custom domain name in GitHub settings\n\n### If Your Site Shows as "Not Secure":\n\n1. **Check if you\'re using HTTP instead of HTTPS** in the URL\n2. **Verify certificate provisioning** is complete (padlock in browser)\n3. **Look for mixed content** (HTTP resources on an HTTPS page)\n\n### If You Need to Remove and Re-add Your Custom Domain:\n\n1. **Go to GitHub repository settings**\n2. **Remove the custom domain** temporarily\n3. **Save changes**\n4. **Add the custom domain back**\n5. **Re-check "Enforce HTTPS"**\n\nThis approach allows you to set up SSL for your GitHub Pages custom domain entirely through web interfaces without needing terminal access.\n\n<function_calls>\n<ask>\n# Setting Up SSL Without Terminal Access\n\nNo problem!

Add CNAME record for www subdomain:\n   - Type: CNAME\n   - Host: www\n   - Value: yourusername.github.io\n\n## 3. Verify Your Setup\n\n- Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)\n- Visit https://legal-prejudice-analysis.com\n- Look for the padlock icon in your browser\n\nNo terminal commands needed! Everything can be done through web interfaces. Would you like more specific guidance for a particular domain registrar?\n</ask>\n</function_calls>', 'tool_calls': None}
