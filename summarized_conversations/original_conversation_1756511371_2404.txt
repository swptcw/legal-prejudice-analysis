{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "# GitHub Pages Build Issues Found\n\nI can see from the Actions tab screenshot that there are some issues with your GitHub Pages builds. The most recent builds (from 15 minutes ago to 24 minutes ago) are successful (green checkmarks), but there were several failed builds before that (red X marks).\n\n## Understanding the Build Status\n\n- **Recent Successful Builds**: The top 3 builds (from 15-24 minutes ago) show green checkmarks, indicating they completed successfully\n- **Earlier Failed Builds**: The older builds (from 1-4 hours ago) show red X marks, indicating they failed\n\nThis pattern suggests that your recent changes have fixed the issues that were causing the builds to fail. This is good news!\n\n## Next Steps to Ensure Your Site is Working\n\n1. **Check Your Live Site**: Since your recent builds are successful, your site should now be working. Try accessing:\n   - https://www.legal-prejudice-analysis.com\n   - https://www.legal-prejudice-analysis.com/test.html\n\n2. **View Build Details**: You can click on one of the successful builds (green checkmark) to see more details about what was deployed\n\n3. **Clear Browser Cache**: Make sure to clear your browser cache or use an incognito/private window when testing your site\n\n4. **Wait a Bit Longer**: Even though the builds are successful, it can sometimes take a few minutes for the changes to be fully deployed and visible\n\n## If You're Still Experiencing Issues\n\nIf you're still seeing a 404 error despite the successful builds:\n\n1. **Check Build Logs**: Click on the most recent successful build and review the logs to ensure everything deployed correctly\n\n2. **Verify Branch and Folder**: Double-check that GitHub Pages is set to deploy from the main branch and /docs folder\n\n3. **Test with Different Browsers**: Try accessing your site from a different browser or device\n\n4. **Check for Path Issues**: Make sure all file paths in your HTML are correct (relative paths starting from the docs directory)\n\nThe good news is that your recent builds are successful, which strongly suggests that your site should be working now or very soon!\n\n<function_calls>\n<ask>\n# GitHub Pages Build Status Analysis\n\nGood news!
