{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help develop these integration capabilities for the Legal Prejudice Risk Calculator. It was a pleasure working on this project with you.\n\nThe integration framework we've created will make it much easier for legal practitioners to incorporate prejudice risk assessment into their existing workflows through their case management systems. The API server, client integration examples, and detailed documentation provide a solid foundation for implementing these capabilities.\n\nIf you need any further assistance with this project in the future - whether it's implementing the API server, developing additional integration components, or enhancing the existing functionality - please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to work on this important tool that can help improve the legal system by addressing potential judicial prejudice in a systematic way.\n<function_calls>\n<complete>\n<!-- This tool indicates successful completion of all tasks -->\n<!-- The system will stop execution after this tool is used -->\n</complete>\n</function_calls>", 'tool_calls': None}
