{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '# Alternative DNS Configuration for Your Domain\n\nI understand you\'re having trouble adding the A record with the `@` symbol. This is a common issue with some domain registrars. Let me provide alternative approaches:\n\n## Different Ways to Configure A Records for Apex Domain\n\n### Option 1: Leave the Host Field Empty\n\nSome registrars require you to leave the host/name field empty instead of using `@`:\n\n- **Type**: A\n- **Host/Name**: (leave blank)\n- **Value/Points to**: 185.199.108.153\n- **TTL**: Auto or 3600\n\n### Option 2: Use Your Actual Domain Name\n\nSome registrars require you to enter your full domain name:\n\n- **Type**: A\n- **Host/Name**: legal-prejudice-analysis.com\n- **Value/Points to**: 185.199.108.153\n- **TTL**: Auto or 3600\n\n### Option 3: Use Root, Apex, or @\n\nDifferent registrars use different terminology:\n\n- **Type**: A\n- **Host/Name**: root (or apex or @)\n- **Value/Points to**: 185.199.108.153\n- **TTL**: Auto or 3600\n\n## Which Domain Registrar Are You Using?\n\nDifferent registrars have different interfaces. If you let me know which registrar you\'re using (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.), I can provide more specific instructions for that platform.\n\n## Alternative Approach: Using Only WWW Subdomain\n\nIf you continue to have issues with the apex domain, you can use only the www subdomain as your primary domain:\n\n1. **Add only the CNAME record**:\n   - Type: CNAME\n   - Host/Name: www\n   - Value/Points to: yourusername.github.io.\n\n2. **Update GitHub Pages settings**:\n   - Set custom domain to: www.legal-prejudice-analysis.com\n   - Update CNAME file to contain: www.legal-prejudice-analysis.com\n\nThis approach is simpler but means users must always use the www prefix.\n\n## Using Domain Forwarding\n\nIf your registrar offers domain forwarding:\n\n1. **Set up domain forwarding**:\n   - Forward legal-prejudice-analysis.com to www.legal-prejudice-analysis.com\n   - Enable "masked" or "cloaked" forwarding if available\n\n2. **Set up the www subdomain with CNAME**:\n   - Type: CNAME\n   - Host/Name: www\n   - Value/Points to: yourusername.github.io.\n\n3. **Update GitHub Pages settings**:\n   - Set custom domain to: www.legal-prejudice-analysis.com\n   - Update CNAME file accordingly\n\n<function_calls>\n<ask>\nI understand you\'re having trouble adding the A record with the @ symbol.
