I\'ve now completed the initial phase of the website implementation plan for the Legal Prejudice Analysis project, which addresses several items from your original todo list, particularly in the Technology Integration section.\n\n## Completed Items from Original Todo List\n\n1. **Technology Integration**\n   - ✅ Developed concept for software tool implementing the framework\n   - ✅ Created data visualization templates for prejudice risk analysis\n   - ✅ Explored technology integration for the framework\n\n2. **Implementation Resources**\n   - ✅ Created structure for training materials\n   - ✅ Developed structure for quick-reference guides\n\n## Main Deliverables Created\n\n1. **DNS Configuration Guide** (dns_configuration_guide.md)\n   - Complete instructions for setting up all required DNS records\n   - Configuration for GitHub Pages with custom domains\n\n2. **Implementation Plan** (implementation_plan.md)\n   - Comprehensive website structure with specialized subdomains\n   - Prioritized tasks and timeline\n   - GitHub repository organization strategy\n\n3. **Project Summary** (project_summary.md)\n   - Overview of the entire implementation\n   - Current status and next steps\n\n4. **Detailed Structure Documents** for each component:\n   - Documentation hub structure\n   - Interactive demo structure\n   - API documentation structure\n   - Downloads portal structure\n   - Community forum structure\n   - GitHub repository structure\n\n5. **Updated Main Website HTML**\n   - Fixed all GitHub repository links\n   - Updated all subdomain URLs\n\n## Next Steps\n\nBased on your original todo list, I recommend focusing on:\n\n1. **Documentation Hub Implementation**\n   - Convert existing markdown documentation to HTML\n   - Implement search functionality\n   - Create cross-references between documents (from your todo list)\n\n2. **Interactive Demo Development**\n   - Implement the risk calculator functionality\n   - Create interactive tools/templates (from your todo list)\n   - Develop data visualization components\n\n3. **Training Materials**\n   - Develop the training materials structure outlined in the docs\n   - Create educational resources for legal teams (from your todo list)\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Begin implementing the documentation hub to address the cross-referencing item from your todo list?\n2. Focus on the interactive demo to address the "interactive tools/templates" item?\n3. Work on another specific component from your original todo list?\n\nI\'m ready to proceed with the next phase based on your preference.\n</ask>\n</function_calls>', 'tool_calls': None}
