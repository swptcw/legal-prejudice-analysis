{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "I've now completed the development of integration capabilities for the Legal Prejudice Risk Calculator. Let me summarize what I've created:\n\n## Integration Capabilities Development Summary\n\n### 1. API Integration Plan\nI've created a comprehensive API integration plan (`api_integration_plan.md`) that outlines:\n- Core API endpoints for assessment management, factor management, results calculation, and CMS integration\n- Authentication and security measures\n- Implementation phases\n- Technical specifications for data models and documentation\n\n### 2. API Server Implementation\nI've developed a functional API server (`api_server.py`) using Flask that implements:\n- RESTful endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting assessments\n- Factor management and risk calculation\n- CMS linking functionality\n- Authentication and error handling\n\n### 3. CMS Integration Example\nI've created a client-side integration example (`cms_integration_example.py`) that demonstrates:\n- How to authenticate with the API\n- Creating and managing assessments\n- Submitting factor ratings\n- Calculating risk scores\n- Linking assessments to CMS cases\n\n### 4. CMS Integration Guide\nI've written a detailed integration guide (`cms_integration_guide.md`) that covers:\n- Step-by-step instructions for integrating with popular case management systems (Clio, Practice Panther, MyCase, Rocket Matter)\n- Custom CMS integration approaches\n- Security best practices\n- Troubleshooting common issues\n\n### 5. Webhook Implementation Specification\nI've created a webhook implementation specification (`webhook_implementation_spec.md`) that details:\n- Event types and payload formats\n- Security considerations including payload signing\n- Retry logic and delivery management\n- Implementation roadmap and testing guidelines\n- Sample webhook handler code\n\n## Key Features of the Integration\n\n1. **Bidirectional Data Flow**: The integration enables data to flow seamlessly between the Legal Prejudice Risk Calculator and case management systems.\n\n2. **Real-time Updates**: Webhooks provide immediate notifications when assessments are created, updated, or when risk levels change.\n\n3. **Secure Authentication**: The API uses API key authentication with best practices for secure key management.\n\n4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides and examples make implementation straightforward for developers.\n\n5. **Flexible Integration Options**: Support for various integration approaches, from direct API integration to middleware connectors.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nTo further enhance the integration capabilities, consider:\n\n1. **Implementing the API Server**: Deploy the API server in a production environment with proper security measures.\n\n2. **Developing SDK Libraries**: Create client libraries in common languages (JavaScript, PHP, Ruby) to simplify integration.\n\n3. **Building Integration Plugins**: Develop ready-to-use plugins for major case management systems.\n\n4. **Creating a Developer Portal**: Establish a developer portal with interactive API documentation, testing tools, and support resources.\n\n5. **Implementing Webhooks**: Deploy the webhook system to enable real-time notifications and data synchronization.\n\nThese integration capabilities will significantly enhance the utility of the Legal Prejudice Risk Calculator by embedding it directly into legal practitioners' existing workflows, making prejudice risk assessment a seamless part of case management.\n<function_calls>\n<complete>\n<!-- This tool indicates successful completion of all tasks -->\n<!-- The system will stop execution after this tool is used -->\n</complete>\n</function_calls>", 'tool_calls': None}
