The primers have been created\\\\nunder the direction of a Steering Group initially chaired by Lord Hughes of Ombersley\\\\nwho was succeeded by Lady Justice Rafferty DBE, and are designed to assist the\\\\njudiciary when handling scientific evidence in the courtroom. They have been written\\\\nby leading scientists and members of the judiciary, peer reviewed by practitioners and\\\\napproved by the Councils of the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\\\\n\\\\nEach primer presents an easily understood, accurate position on the scientific topic in\\\\nquestion, and considers the limitations of the science and the challenges associated\\\\nwith its application. The way scientific evidence is used can vary between jurisdictions,\\\\nbut the underpinning science and methodologies remain consistent. For this reason\\\\nwe trust these primers will prove helpful in many jurisdictions throughout the world\\\\nand assist the judiciary in their understanding of scientific topics. The primers are not\\\\nintended to replace expert scientific evidence; they are intended to help understand\\\\nit and assess it, by providing a basic, and so far as possible uncontroversial, statement\\\\nof the underlying science.\\\\n\\\\nThe production of this primer on the use of statistics in legal proceedings has been\\\\nled by Professor Niamh Nic Dae\\\\u0301id FRSE. We are most grateful to her, to the Executive\\\\nDirector of the Royal Society, Dr Julie Maxton CBE, the Chief Executive of the Royal\\\\nSociety of Edinburgh, Dr Rebekah Widdowfield, and the members of the Primers\\\\nSteering Group, the Editorial Board and the Writing Group. Please see the back page\\\\nfor a full list of acknowledgements.\\\\n\\\\n**Sir Venki Ramakrishnan** **Dame Anne Glover**\\\\n**President of the Royal Society** **President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh**\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n## Summary, introduction and scope\\\\n\\\\nThe aim of this primer is to provide assistance to the judiciary and legal professionals\\\\nin understanding the principles of evaluating evidence (that has a statistical basis)\\\\npresented in the courts. The primer is presented in two parts. The first part provides\\\\na general introduction to the use of statistical and probabilistic tools within legal\\\\nprocesses with some examples presented, including some relating to evidence types\\\\ncommonly presented to the courts.\\\\n\\\\nThe second part consists of five appendices.\\\\n\\\\nAppendices 1 \\\\u2013 3 provide specific information about how statistical and probabilistic\\\\ntools may be used in assisting the delivery of evaluative opinions by forensic\\\\npractitioners relating to common types of scientific evidence encountered primarily\\\\nin criminal cases, for example trace evidence (eg fibres, glass, DNA) and impression\\\\nevidence (eg footwear marks, toolmarks, fingerprints).\\\\n\\\\nAppendices 4 and 5 relate to specific statistical methods and to their use in assessing\\\\nstatistical significance and relative risk. These areas generally have more relevance in\\\\ncivil proceedings.\\\\n\\\\nThis short guide cannot equip the judiciary and legal professionals with all the\\\\nnecessary skills required, but it should be useful for signposting where problems\\\\nmay arise and where external expertise may be needed.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n## 1. What is statistical science?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning about data is increasingly recognised as an essential skill for modern life.\\\\nFact-finding and the assessment of expert evidence in court cases often requires an\\\\nunderstanding of probability, statistics and numbers. Various different statistical and\\\\nprobabilistic tools can be used to address different questions relating to the context\\\\nof individual cases presented to the courts and the choice of which tools to use will\\\\ndepend on the questions that need to be addressed. Standard types of questions\\\\nwhich can be answered by statistical science may be categorised as follows:\\\\n\\\\n-  Descriptive statistics: eg What is the number of rapes reported in the country?\\\\nHow many drugs of a particular type are found in drug seizures?\\\\n\\\\n-  Inference from observed data to a larger population: eg Given the responses\\\\nto the British Crime Survey, what is the estimated number of illegal drug users\\\\nin the UK?\\\\n\\\\n-  Inference from observed data to a scientific conclusion: eg Did the exposure to\\\\nthe emissions from an incinerator raise the risk of birth defects 1 ?\\\\n\\\\n-  Prediction: eg Given a set of characteristics, what is the chance that the accused\\\\nwill reoffend 2 ?\\\\n\\\\n-  Evaluation: The evaluation of scientific findings in court uses probability as a measure\\\\nof uncertainty. This is based upon the findings, associated data, expert knowledge,\\\\ncase-specific propositions and conditioning information 3 .\\\\n\\\\nAll these situations are characterised by uncertainty, and probability theory provides\\\\nthe tools and language for handling and communicating uncertainty.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nStatistical science has developed a wide range of powerful techniques for quantifying\\\\nthe impact of some sources of uncertainty, eg calculating margins of error from a survey,\\\\nmeasuring the support for a proposition (also called a hypothesis) from observed data\\\\nor assessing the probability of a future event. Other sources of uncertainty are not\\\\nso easily quantified but can still be informally assessed and communicated, eg those\\\\narising from the reliability of survey respondents, the quality of scientific studies and\\\\nthe relevance of available and good quality datasets to the facts of a legal case.\\\\n\\\\nUnavoidable uncertainty about the future is often termed chance, also known as\\\\naleatory uncertainty, and the assignment of probabilities to future events is familiar.\\\\nLegal cases generally deal with uncertainty in the sense of lack of knowledge, also\\\\nknown as epistemic uncertainty. Fortunately, the theory of probability can still be applied\\\\nin this context. Uncertainty of measurement can also arise and this, in general, can be\\\\ncharacterised for objective measurements (eg how much of a controlled substance may\\\\nbe in an analysed sample) but is more challenging for more subjective measurements\\\\n(eg in the examination of toolmarks).\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**1.1 Use of statistical science and types of evidence**\\\\nStatistical science can be called upon to support expert knowledge when dealing\\\\nwith a variety of types of evidence and proceedings. These include:\\\\n\\\\n-  evaluation of DNA evidence 4 ;\\\\n\\\\n-  evaluation of trace evidence, eg fibres, glass, paint or firearms discharge residues\\\\n(Appendix 2);\\\\n\\\\n-  evaluation of pattern-matching evidence, eg toolmarks, ballistics and fingerprint\\\\nevidence (Appendix 3); and\\\\n\\\\n-  causation of illness or injury in a civil case, where it may be helpful to apply\\\\nepidemiological research (the study of occurrence, aetiology, prognosis and\\\\ntreatment of illness in populations) to individual cases (Appendix 5).\\\\n\\\\nThe way in which statistical science may be used in a legal context is illustrated in\\\\nFigure 1.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**FIGURE 1**\\\\n\\\\nThe process by which statistical science may be used in legal proceedings and in\\\\nwhich relevant past data are used to draw conclusions about the facts of a current case.\\\\n\\\\n1. Identification of an observation related to a specific item of evidence relevant\\\\nto some aspect of the current case.\\\\n\\\\n2. Providing a list of appropriate potential propositions concerning the\\\\nevidence, which may include prosecution allegations and any defence\\\\nalternative assertions.\\\\n\\\\n3. Identifying resources containing relevant past data or creating new\\\\nrelevant datasets.\\\\n\\\\n4. Methods for using the accumulated information in a database (if available) to\\\\nderive a numerical or verbal expression of the probative value of the observation\\\\nrelated to the item of evidence with regard to the competing propositions.\\\\n\\\\n5. Communication of probative value of evidence.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**1.2 Communication of the probative value when statistical science is used**\\\\nWhen conclusions based on statistical science are drawn from data, it is crucial that\\\\nthe data and the reasoning supporting those conclusions are transparent. Under the\\\\nterm \\\\u2018intelligent transparency\\\\u2019 Baroness Onora O\\\\u2019Neill 5 has argued that the data\\\\nand reasoning must be:\\\\n\\\\n-  accessible: ie easily available and not, for example, hidden behind\\\\na proprietary algorithm;\\\\n\\\\n-  understandable: to everyone involved in the case, including a jury;\\\\n\\\\n-  useable: they address current specific concerns; and\\\\n\\\\n-  assessable: where the \\\\u2018working\\\\u2019 is open to scrutiny by legal and other professionals.\\\\n\\\\nThere is always uncertainty involved in statistics, particularly in assessing the\\\\nrelevance of available historical data to a current case. There may also be some\\\\nextent of disagreement between different professionals, but this may not be of real\\\\nsubstance. Statistical conclusions are only as reliable as the model (and data) from\\\\nwhich they are derived.\\\\n\\\\nEstimates are neither wholly right nor wholly wrong, conclusions are not mechanistic\\\\nand sometimes the only database available is the experience of the professional. In\\\\nsuch situations transparency is particularly necessary and the experience needs to be\\\\ndocumented with emphasis on the relevance to the case in question. The professional\\\\njudgement of the appropriate experts (expert knowledge) is inevitably involved in each\\\\nstage of the process outlined in Figure 1. Probability is a conceptual device that helps\\\\nus think and reason logically when faced with uncertainty about the occurrence of a\\\\nquestioned event in the past, present or the future.\\\\n\\\\nProbability helps us think clearly and coherently about uncertain events.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**FIGURE 2**\\\\n\\\\nExpected frequency tree when repeating a double-flip of a coin 100 times. We would\\\\nexpect the first flip to be heads in 50 of these experiments, and both flips to be heads\\\\nin 25.\\\\n\\\\n**Second**\\\\n\\\\n**First**\\\\n\\\\n**Heads**\\\\n\\\\n**25**\\\\n\\\\n**Heads**\\\\n\\\\n**50**\\\\n\\\\n**Tails**\\\\n\\\\n**25**\\\\n\\\\n**100**\\\\n\\\\n**Tails**\\\\n\\\\n**25**\\\\n\\\\n**Heads**\\\\n\\\\n**50**\\\\n\\\\n**Tails**\\\\n\\\\n**25**\\\\n\\\\nBy way of an example to explain probability, we can use the idea of \\\\u2018expected\\\\nfrequency\\\\u2019 (such a frequentist approach is not appropriate in forensic inference\\\\nwhere probability is conditional and personal but is used here to explain the notion\\\\nof probability). When faced with a question concerning likely outcomes if a coin is\\\\nflipped twice, you ask yourself: What would I expect to happen if I tried the experiment\\\\nmany times? Take the example that you repeated this double-flip experiment 100\\\\ntimes. As shown in Figure 2, in 25 out of these 100 repeats you would expect to get\\\\ntwo heads. Therefore, the reasoning goes, the probability that on a particular attempt\\\\nyou would get two heads is 1 in 4, or \\\\u00bc. Which, fortunately, is the correct answer.\\\\nThis probability can be equivalently expressed as a fraction (\\\\u00bc), a decimal (0.25),\\\\na percentage (25%), a proportion (1 out of 4) or betting odds (3 to 1 against).\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nProbability follows basic rules in which:\\\\n\\\\n-  probabilities of all possible events add to 1 (eg in Figure 2 there are four possible\\\\nevents, so their probabilities add to 1); the probability of not getting two heads is\\\\n\\\\u00be or 75%;\\\\n\\\\n-  probabilities are multiplied for sequences of events which are independent\\\\n(eg the probability of two heads in a row is \\\\u00bd \\\\u00d7 \\\\u00bd = \\\\u00bc); and\\\\n\\\\n-  probabilities are added when considering probabilities of separate\\\\n(mutually exclusive) sets of events (eg the probability of getting two\\\\nheads or two tails is \\\\u00bc + \\\\u00bc = \\\\u00bd).\\\\n\\\\nIt is a common misapprehension that probabilities can only be used for future events\\\\nwith some randomness. While it is true that an event has either happened or not,\\\\nmany statisticians will feel that it is reasonable to assign probabilities to our personal\\\\nuncertainty about unknown facts, as the following example shows.\\\\n\\\\nSuppose I have a coin and I ask you for your probability that it will come up heads.\\\\nYou answer \\\\u201c50:50\\\\u201d, or similar (50% or \\\\u00bd). Then I flip it, cover up the result before either\\\\nof us sees it and again ask for your probability that it is heads. You may, after a pause,\\\\nsay \\\\u201c50:50\\\\u201d. Then I take a quick look at the coin, without showing you, and repeat the\\\\nquestion. Again, if you are like most people, you eventually say \\\\u201c50:50\\\\u201d. This simple\\\\nexercise reveals a major distinction between two types of uncertainty: what is known\\\\nas aleatory uncertainty before I flip the coin \\\\u2013 the \\\\u2018chance\\\\u2019 of an unpredictable event \\\\u2013\\\\nand epistemic uncertainty after I flip the coin \\\\u2013 an expression of our personal ignorance\\\\nabout an event that is fixed but unknown. In forensic science we are almost always\\\\nconcerned with epistemic uncertainty about the facts of a past situation.\\\\n\\\\nProbabilities are commonly used to express epistemic uncertainty in legal settings.\\\\nSection 2 provides more detail on the meaning of probability in such contexts, including\\\\nBayes\\\\u2019 theorem and the role of the likelihood ratio (LR).\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n## 2. \\\\u0007Probability and the principles of evaluating scientific evidence\\\\n\\\\nSpecifically, in a legal context, probability can help fact-finders assess the impact of\\\\nevidence on the truth or otherwise of a particular proposition. It has a well-documented\\\\nhistory in academic legal literature 6 . Each item of evidence can be used to support one\\\\nor more proposition(s). Evidence may, on occasion, point directly to incriminating or\\\\nexculpating a suspect of a particular crime, but will more likely have probative value in\\\\ndiscriminating between competing propositions for either the source of some material\\\\nfound in relation to a scene of the crime or an alleged activity connected to a crime.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, competing source-level propositions concerning a fragment of glass found\\\\non a suspect\\\\u2019s clothing might include that the glass fragments came, or did not come,\\\\nfrom a particular broken window. Competing activity-level propositions might be that the\\\\nsuspect broke or did not break the particular glass in question at a particular time.\\\\n\\\\n**2.1 What probability is not**\\\\nProbability is not an inherent property of material or objects. For example, a pack of\\\\nplaying cards does not possess a specific probability for an ace being drawn from it.\\\\nBut you may say, given your current state of knowledge about the properties of the\\\\npack, \\\\u201cthat the probability of drawing an ace from a pack of playing cards is 4 in 52, or\\\\n1 in 13\\\\u201d. Such a probability is based on certain assumptions. It is assumed that, among\\\\nother considerations, (i) it is a full pack of 52 cards; (ii) it is well shuffled; (iii) the cards are\\\\nexactly the same shape, size and condition so as not to influence the physical act of a\\\\ndraw; and (iv) the person drawing the card will do so without any bias. The probability\\\\nfigure of 1/13 (or roughly 8%) is your own best assessment, based on your knowledge of\\\\nthe composition of a full pack of cards and based on the implicit assumptions outlined.\\\\nIt is a probability with which most of us would agree and it is one that would work\\\\nwell in gambling games, but it is not an inherent property of the aces in the pack or\\\\nof any of the other cards in the pack. The implication here is that even in cases with\\\\nwell-structured chance devices, such as a deck of cards, if you have already been\\\\ndealt a couple of aces, your probability for the next card being an ace has dropped\\\\nconsiderably. Probability is personal: it is personal in the sense that it depends on the\\\\nknowledge available to the person making the judgement and on the assumptions\\\\nthey make.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nBut that is not to say that personal probability is conjured up on a whim or a preference,\\\\nor to suggest it is not based on acquired data. Where relevant data are available, it is\\\\nexpected that they will be taken into account in assigning a probability. For example,\\\\nsuppose that reliable information is available on the proportion of individuals in a target\\\\npopulation that possess a particular observable feature, such as skin, hair or eye colour.\\\\nThen, our assessment that a person drawn randomly from that population will show a\\\\nparticular feature of interest ought to be informed by the available knowledge about the\\\\ncomposition of the population. When new testing systems are used, the frequencies of\\\\ngiven traits in a population will not be widely known.\\\\n\\\\n**2.2 Personal probabilities**\\\\nWe make personal assignments of probability every day:\\\\n\\\\n-  What is the probability that I will miss the bus this morning if I have one more\\\\ncup of coffee?\\\\n\\\\n-  What is the probability that I will be caught if I break into this property?\\\\n\\\\nIn such circumstances, the probabilities that we assign, albeit not mathematically\\\\nevaluated or even verbalised in this way, will depend on our knowledge and\\\\nunderstanding of the factors and risks involved. Such probabilities are also known\\\\nas personal \\\\u2018degrees of belief\\\\u2019.\\\\n\\\\nSome people may attempt to answer the above questions by thinking of past\\\\nexperiences in similar situations. For example, they may consider how many mornings\\\\nin the past they have missed the bus when having one more cup of coffee, though this\\\\nmay give rise to many other questions, such as the extent to which today\\\\u2019s morning is\\\\ncomparable to previous experiences.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nStatisticians and scientists refer to data on the proportion of times an event has occurred\\\\nas a relative frequency. However, and most importantly, there are some situations\\\\nfor which relative frequencies cannot be meaningfully conceived. In legal cases, for\\\\nexample, the fact-finder must deal with singular, non-repeatable, one-off events for\\\\nwhich the notion of relative frequency may not be helpful. This does not preclude\\\\nthe possibility that useful frequency data may be available (eg scientific data on the\\\\noccurrence of genetic features or the prevalence of a disease) to help decide aspects\\\\nof the case (examples of this type of use are in Appendices 4 and 5). Where such data\\\\nare available and are relevant, they ought to be used in probability assignment as one\\\\nsource of information among others.\\\\n\\\\nExperts assign personal probabilities based on their experience, knowledge and\\\\nunderstanding of their type of expert evidence. However, a challenge with such\\\\nprobabilities is the potential influence of cognitive effects. The reliability of expertassigned probabilities is determined by various factors, including:\\\\n\\\\n-  the extent and relevance of the expert\\\\u2019s experience;\\\\n\\\\n-  the ability of the expert to compile and store systematically those experiences\\\\nin their memory;\\\\n\\\\n-  the expert\\\\u2019s ability to recall accurately the relevant data;\\\\n\\\\n-  the expert\\\\u2019s ability to avoid and mitigate against bias while inputting expert\\\\nknowledge; and\\\\n\\\\n-  calibration, ie measuring the extent to which those events assigned a probability\\\\nof (say) 40% actually do have a relative frequency of occurrence close to 40%.\\\\n\\\\nIn general, the more that experts base their assignments of probability on relevant,\\\\nshared and robust data, the greater is the trustworthiness of those assignments. The\\\\nmore they base their assignments on their recalled experience and knowledge and\\\\non their intuition, the more those assignments will be open to justified challenge.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**2.3 Datasets containing relevant past observations**\\\\nEvaluation of evidence using likelihood ratios (LRs) often involves the use of datasets\\\\nand statistical assumptions. It is important that these datasets, assumptions and\\\\ncalculations are clearly stated and appropriate for the problem. Validation tests should\\\\nbe carried out to gauge the statistical assumptions and to ensure that the LR values\\\\npresented in court are reliable. Datasets should be from relevant populations and\\\\nshould not bias the results of the analysis.\\\\n\\\\nThe Court of Appeal decided in Regina v Abadom 7 that an expert is entitled to draw\\\\nupon material produced by others in the field in which his or her expertise lies, and\\\\nindeed where any reliable data are available that bear upon the question the expert\\\\nis addressing. It is part of the duty of the expert to take this into account. So, a crucial\\\\njudgement concerns the reliability and relevance of available data. The dataset\\\\nshould have high intrinsic quality, reliability and high relevance to the question being\\\\naddressed by the use of the data. A national dataset of informally collected examples\\\\nof glass or footwear from people\\\\u2019s homes may be of limited relevance to local criminal\\\\ninvestigations but of value in informing background abundance of the items in question,\\\\nwhile local datasets collected to address specific aspects of criminal incidents or of\\\\nsuspect populations may have high relevance. Ideally, there will be an appropriately\\\\nlarge enough random sample from a population that matches agreed features of the\\\\ncase, but this is a high bar that is rarely achieved and means that expert judgement and\\\\nfull transparency are required to deal with such limitations.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**2.4 Probative value expressed as a likelihood ratio**\\\\nTechnically, the LR is the probability of the evidence assuming that proposition A is true\\\\ndivided by the probability of the evidence assuming tha proposition B is true:\\\\n\\\\nLR =\\\\n\\\\nprobability of the evidence, if A is true\\\\n\\\\nprobability of the evidence, if B is true\\\\n\\\\nLRs are typically attached to DNA evidence in which a \\\\u2018match\\\\u2019 of some degree is found\\\\nbetween the suspect\\\\u2019s DNA profile and the DNA profile derived from a trace found at\\\\nthe scene of a crime. The two competing hypotheses are that the DNA profile in the\\\\nrecovered trace material originates from the suspect or it originates from someone else,\\\\nso that we can express the LR as:\\\\n\\\\n|LR =|probability of the DNA profile \\\\u2018match\\\\u2019, if the suspect left the trace|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n||probability of the DNA profile \\\\u2018match\\\\u2019, if the trace was left by someone else|\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\u2018DNA evidence\\\\u2019 is the suspect\\\\u2019s DNA together with the DNA trace from the crime\\\\nscene. For the specific situation when the trace contains plenty of DNA and it is deemed\\\\nto have come from one person, the LR above can be written, after some mathematical\\\\noperations and given some assumptions, as:\\\\n\\\\n|LR =|1|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n||random match probability|\\\\n\\\\nThe random match probability is the probability of finding an evidence match if selecting\\\\nat random from within a particular population. For example, in the context of a DNA\\\\nsample 8 , it is the probability of observing a DNA profile of an unknown person that is the\\\\nsame as the DNA profile from a crime scene stain (and assuming a particular population\\\\ngenetic model). Typical LRs for DNA evidence are in the millions or billions, although\\\\nthe exact values may be contested, such as when there are complications due to the\\\\ntraces containing a mix of DNA from multiple people. Further information is provided in\\\\nForensic DNA analysis: a primer for the courts 9 .\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nTable 1 shows an example of a verbal scale used for communicating LRs (a similar\\\\nexample can be found in Willis 10 ). In most cases (including DNA at an activity level where\\\\nthe activity that caused the DNA to be deposited is the issue) the LR will be based on\\\\na semi-quantitative (ie an order of magnitude) assessment and a verbal equivalent may\\\\nbe presented to the court. The reason that verbal expressions are defined numerically\\\\nis to provide a consistency in their use rather than to translate available numbers into a\\\\ncommon language. In those cases where a quantitative assignment is possible there is\\\\na strong argument for presenting the LR value to the court without a verbal qualifier but\\\\nalso an argument for avoiding the risk that lay persons (eg juries) may misunderstand\\\\nconclusions stated in numbers as absolute measurements. An LR equal to 1 supports\\\\nneither proposition preferentially.\\\\n\\\\nThe LR is not a specific measurement, but rather is the weight of evidence of the\\\\nscientific findings in two competing scenarios (prosecution and defence). There will\\\\nalmost always be some natural variation in LRs depending on different assumptions\\\\nand the quality and relevance of the datasets and what is known about the transfer,\\\\npersistence, recovery and background abundance of the particular type of evidence\\\\nunder scrutiny. The value of the LR on the scale shown in Table 1 is preferably assigned\\\\nbased on robust data extracted from a relevant dataset.\\\\n\\\\nWith good quality and relevant data it may be possible to generate a numerical\\\\nassessment using the LR relating to evidential support. However, often the available\\\\ndata are either poor or non-existent (particularly true for knowledge relating to the\\\\ntransfer of material and its persistence once transferred). In such cases, the expert\\\\nforms a personal opinion based on domain knowledge of processes and on personal\\\\nexperience that can be disclosed and audited. In these situations, verbal expressions\\\\nor orders of magnitude of the LR may be helpful and the basis of any statement of\\\\nexpert opinion formed this way must always be made clear.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**TABLE 1**\\\\n\\\\nExample of verbal interpretations of likelihood ratios (LRs) \\\\u2013 in this case for source-\\\\nlevel propositions.\\\\n\\\\n|Value of LR|Verbal equivalent|Supported proposition|\\\\n|---|---|---|\\\\n|<0.000001|Extremely strong support|Different source|\\\\n|0.0001-0.000001|Very strong support||\\\\n|0.001 \\\\u2013 0.0001|Strong support||\\\\n|0.01 \\\\u2013 0.001|Moderately strong support||\\\\n|0.1 \\\\u2013 0.01|Moderate support||\\\\n|<1 \\\\u2013 0.1|Limited (or weak) support||\\\\n|About 1|Neutral|Neither proposition is supported in preference to the other|\\\\n|>1 \\\\u2013 10|Limited (weak) support|Same source|\\\\n|10 \\\\u2013 100|Moderate support||\\\\n|100 \\\\u2013 1,000|Moderately strong support||\\\\n|1,000 \\\\u2013 10,000|Strong support||\\\\n|10,000 \\\\u2013 1,000,000|Very strong support||\\\\n|>1,000,000|Extremely strong support||\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**2.5 Bayes\\\\u2019 theorem and the likelihood ratio**\\\\nBayes\\\\u2019 theorem provides a general rule for updating probabilities about a proposition in\\\\nthe light of new evidence. It says that:\\\\n\\\\nthe LR x the prior\\\\nthe posterior (final) odds for a proposition =\\\\n(initial) odds for the proposition\\\\n\\\\nFor example, suppose a hypothetical screening test for doping in sports is claimed to\\\\nbe \\\\u201895% accurate\\\\u2019, meaning that if an athlete is doping there is a 95% chance (probability\\\\n0.95; sensitivity) of obtaining a positive test result, and if the athlete is a non-doper\\\\nthere is a 95% chance (probability 0.95; specificity) of obtaining a negative test result.\\\\nSuch general performance characteristics have been determined through tests under\\\\ncontrolled conditions, ie by applying the test in so-called ground truth cases, where it is\\\\nknown whether a tested person is doping or not.\\\\n\\\\nAssuming that the odds of an athlete taking drugs prior to being subject to a screening\\\\ntest are 1 in 50 (1:50), then if an athlete tests positive what is the probability that they are\\\\ntruly doping?\\\\n\\\\nThe LR (explained in Section 2.4) is the probability of a positive test given the\\\\nproposition that the athlete is doping (95%) divided by the probability of a positive test\\\\ngiven the proposition that the athlete is not doping (5%, ie 1 - specificity). This ratio is 19\\\\n(LR = 0.95/0.05 = 19).\\\\n\\\\nBayes\\\\u2019 theorem tells us that the posterior odds of the athlete having taken drugs can be\\\\ncomputed by multiplying the prior odds of that proposition by the LR provided by the\\\\npositive test. In this form, we have to work with odds not probability. Odds are related\\\\nmathematically to probability and a very simple conversion can be used to give the\\\\nvalue for probability where the odds of m:n correspond to the probability m/(m + n).\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nSo, for the doping example,\\\\n\\\\n-  the prior odds for the proposition \\\\u2018athlete is doping\\\\u2019 versus \\\\u2018athlete is not doping\\\\u2019\\\\nare 1:50, which correspond to a probability of 1/(1 + 50) or a prior probability of\\\\napproximately 0.02 (the actual value is 0.0196, which is equivalent to 1.96%);\\\\n\\\\n-  the LR is 0.95/0.05 = 19; and\\\\n\\\\n-  therefore, by Bayes\\\\u2019 theorem, the posterior odds that the athlete is doping are (1:50)\\\\nx 19 = 19:50, giving a posterior probability of doping of 19/(19 + 50) \\\\u2248 0.28 or 28%.\\\\n\\\\nSo, even though drug testing could be claimed to be \\\\u201895% accurate\\\\u2019 (based on the\\\\nsensitivity and specificity metric) this does not mean that, in the event of a positive result,\\\\nthere is a 95% chance that the athlete is doping. In this example, the probability that the\\\\nathlete is doping, given a positive test result, is approximately 28%. The posterior odds\\\\nthat an athlete is doping crucially depend on the prior odds for the proposition \\\\u2018athlete is\\\\ndoping\\\\u2019 versus \\\\u2018athlete is not doping\\\\u2019 (in the example this was 1:50) prior to considering\\\\nthe result of the screening test (the LR result). This means that if conclusions are drawn\\\\nfrom test results in isolation there could be misinterpretations of what is meant by the\\\\naccuracy of the test. This could cause conclusions such as athletes being incorrectly\\\\naccused of doping because they failed a drug test.\\\\n\\\\nIn practice, the Court of Appeal has ruled that Bayes\\\\u2019 theorem should not be used by\\\\na jury to combine and weigh evidence 11 , but LRs assessed by experts are permitted if\\\\nthey have a sound basis. Many real-world cases involve multiple and related items of\\\\nevidence, making probabilistic inference much more complex and intricate than the\\\\nillustrative doping example given above.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n## 3. \\\\u0007Issues with the potential for misunderstanding\\\\n\\\\n**3.1 Prosecutor\\\\u2019s fallacy**\\\\nThe prosecutor\\\'s fallacy occurs when the probability of the evidence (matching DNA\\\\nprofile, glass fragment of the same refractive index as the fragment recovered from\\\\nthe target window, etc) given innocence (the random match probability) is incorrectly\\\\ninterpreted as the probability of innocence given the evidence. This is formally known\\\\nas \\\\u2018transposing the conditional\\\\u2019, and is a clear breach of logic that becomes obvious\\\\nwhen the correct statement \\\\u2018If it\\\\u2019s a dog, the chances are very high that it has four legs\\\\u2019\\\\nis transposed to \\\\u2018If an animal has four legs, the chances are very high that it\\\\u2019s a dog\\\\u2019.\\\\n\\\\n**3.2 Defence attorney\\\\u2019s fallacy**\\\\nThe defence attorney\\\\u2019s fallacy occurs when it is reported how many people with\\\\nthe matching characteristics are likely to be found in a defined population (eg the\\\\npopulation of the UK). This assumes that the perpetrator is part of some arbitrarily\\\\nlarge population and that there is no other information available, so that everyone is\\\\nequally likely to be the perpetrator. Under these assumptions, it is deduced that there\\\\nis a small probability that the suspect is the perpetrator. It is a fallacy to infer from this\\\\nthat the evidence is weak.\\\\n\\\\n**3.3 Combining evidence**\\\\nA standard statistical approach is to include all evidence in a single calculation, each\\\\nitem weighted by its relative strength expressed by LRs. This technique is used, for\\\\nexample, in email spam filters and in Case study 1.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**CASE STUDY 1**\\\\n\\\\nAn archaeological case\\\\n\\\\nOn Saturday 25 August 2012, archaeologists began an excavation for Richard III\\\\u2019s\\\\nremains by digging in a car park in Leicester. Within a few hours they found their first\\\\nskeleton and the question was whether this was Richard III. Table 2 shows the specific\\\\nitems of evidence and their likelihood ratios (LRs) regarding the propositions that the\\\\nskeleton was that of Richard III. These LRs were, as far as possible, based on sound\\\\nstatistical evidence, but there was inevitably some uncertainty so that conservative\\\\nvalues were assigned, and verbally interpreted here (because of their uncertainty\\\\nand therefore qualitative nature) using the terms in Table 1.\\\\n\\\\nProbability theory permits, given certain assumptions about the evidence, the\\\\nmultiplication of these LRs to give a final number that represents \\\\u2018extremely strong\\\\u2019\\\\nevidence to support the proposition that the skeleton was, rather than was not, that of\\\\nRichard III. Of course, the final assignation of the skeleton would not be based on the\\\\nLR alone but would involve other evidence as well.\\\\n\\\\n**TABLE 2**\\\\n\\\\nLikelihood ratios (LRs) assessed for items of evidence found on a skeleton\\\\nrecovered in Leicester.\\\\n\\\\n|Evidence|LR  (conservative assignment)|Verbal equivalent|\\\\n|---|---|---|\\\\n|Radiocarbon dating CE 1456 \\\\u2013 1530|1.8|Weak support|\\\\n|Age and sex of skeleton|5.3|Weak support|\\\\n|Scoliosis|212|Moderately strong support|\\\\n|Post-mortem wounds|42|Moderate support|\\\\n|Mitochondrial DNA match|478|Moderately strong support|\\\\n|Y chromosome not matching|0.16|Weak evidence against|\\\\n|Combined evidence|6.5 million|Extremely strong support|\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nSuch an approach is used when combining multiple aspects of a forensic scientist\\\\u2019s\\\\nfindings, eg when combining individual peaks within a DNA profile. Some contrast\\\\nthis with the way in which the law approaches fact-finding in civil cases: \\\\u201bIf a legal rule\\\\nrequires a fact to be proved (a \\\\u201cfact in issue\\\\u201d), a judge or jury must decide whether or\\\\nnot it happened. There is no room for a finding that it might have happened. The law\\\\noperates a binary system in which the only values are 0 and 1. The fact either happened\\\\nor it did not 12 .\\\\u2019\\\\n\\\\nIn statistical science, however, the uncertainty regarding facts is carried through any\\\\nchain of reasoning and influences trust in the final conclusions. The expert can properly\\\\nask what the level of probability or uncertainty is. However, courts are perfectly used to\\\\nbringing into the calculation of a primary conclusion uncertain disputed facts along the\\\\nway and without necessarily resolving each uncertainty. Sometimes evidence going to\\\\ndisputed contributory facts, when combined with other evidence going to a different\\\\ndisputed contributory fact, may enable a conclusion to be reached safely on the\\\\nprincipal fact in issue. Likewise, juries are commonly directed that they do not need to\\\\nresolve every dispute in the evidence, so long as they are satisfied beyond reasonable\\\\ndoubt of the guilt of the accused. Some disputed facts can safely be left unresolved and\\\\nscientific findings will generally have a degree of uncertainty rather than a definite value.\\\\n\\\\n**3.4 Coincidences and rare events**\\\\nIntuition is notoriously poor at assessing how \\\\u2018surprising\\\\u2019 an event is. Just because\\\\nan event is exceedingly rare for a particular person (eg winning the lottery at odds\\\\nof 45 million to 1 against) does not necessarily mean it is a surprising event to occur\\\\nto someone (because of the large number of tickets sold). When three major plane\\\\ncrashes occurred within an eight-day period in 2014, it appeared to many to be beyond\\\\ncoincidence. But there is around a 60% probability that such a \\\\u2018cluster\\\\u2019 will happen at\\\\nsome point over a ten-year period.\\\\n\\\\n**3.5 Interpretation of \\\\u2018beyond reasonable doubt\\\\u2019 and \\\\u2018balance of probabilities\\\\u2019**\\\\nThese might appear to be expressions of probability for either criminal guilt or on\\\\nbehalf of one of the sides in a civil case, respectively. In fact, they relate to the strength\\\\nof the evidence required by the legal system, the prior odds provided for, or against,\\\\na particular explanation of events and the relative merits and losses associated with\\\\naccurate and erroneous consequences of a decision.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n## 4. \\\\u0007The role of expert witnesses and what should be expected from them\\\\n\\\\nThe guidelines for expert witnesses in England and Wales 13 provide a useful reminder\\\\nthat expert witnesses have a duty to give independent, impartial and unbiased\\\\nevidence, and not to stray outside their area of expertise. Crucially, any reference\\\\nto data that have been collected by others has to be justified, and their limitations\\\\ncommunicated clearly. Similar considerations apply in civil cases 14 .\\\\n\\\\nThe Forensic Science Regulator has the responsibility for reporting standards used\\\\nby forensic experts and reports must be structured to provide an understanding of\\\\nthe probative value of the evidence. Crucially, legal professionals should be able\\\\nto recognise complex and non-standard situations in which an expert in probability,\\\\nforensic inference or statistical reasoning may need to be consulted.\\\\n\\\\nCommunication of probability is fraught with the potential for misunderstanding. One\\\\nonly has to look at the classic problem of the prosecutor\\\\u2019s fallacy to see what may\\\\nhappen when such misunderstanding occurs. Judgments from the Court of Appeal (in\\\\nEngland and Wales) relating to expert evidence also reveal a variation in the way in\\\\nwhich the Court understands and accepts or rejects probabilistic evidence. In some\\\\nways, this misunderstanding reflects a basic difference in the manner by which people\\\\nreason and discuss issues. Some prefer a narrative style of argument while others prefer\\\\na numerical approach. This difference does not necessarily correlate with whether you\\\\nare a scientist or a lawyer.\\\\n\\\\nIt is important also to recognise with whom the expert is attempting to communicate.\\\\nIn a criminal court it will be with the magistrates or the jury; in civil litigation it will be\\\\nwith the judge. The onus is on the expert to use simple and accurate language in the\\\\ncommunication of their evidence so that they are understood. It is equally important that\\\\nthe lawyers ask the experts questions such that the full nature of the evidence together\\\\nwith its strengths and limitations are exposed to the recipients (magistrates, judge, jury).\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe Forensic Science Regulator is developing a quality standard for forensic\\\\npractitioners on the development of evaluative opinions. This will set out a standardised,\\\\ntransparent approach to the expression of opinions for forensic science disciplines,\\\\nbased on case-specific propositions. Where it is not possible for numerical values to\\\\nbe assigned to probabilities, a revised verbal scale, with fewer categories than\\\\npresented in Table 1, is being considered. The standard is also expected to require\\\\neach expert to set out the specific data and/or experience and expertise on which their\\\\nevaluation is based.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n## 5. Conclusions and the future\\\\n\\\\nAs forensic tests become more sensitive, and the amount and complexity of scientific\\\\nevidence increases, there will be a need for more sophisticated models and statistics\\\\nto obtain meaningful inferences and interpretation of the evidence given the specific\\\\ncircumstances of a case. This includes the generation of ground truth datasets (where\\\\nthe provenance of the data is known) relating to trace evidence and pattern evidence\\\\nas well as an understanding of the transfer, persistence, recovery and background\\\\nabundance of materials in general and in case-specific circumstances. The development\\\\nof concepts of \\\\u2018calibrated knowledge\\\\u2019 and their use in decision-making in respect to\\\\nthe generation of propositions and the evaluation of these propositions within the\\\\ncontext of cases are highly relevant. There is an increasing use of LR calculations for\\\\npattern evidence where the LR is obtained by dividing two probability assignments. Both\\\\nrequire judgement on the part of the expert based on a corpus of knowledge that can\\\\nbe divided into two broad categories:\\\\n\\\\n[S] Knowledge derived from robust systematic studies, ideally published, where the\\\\nrelevant features have been measured and studied statistically.\\\\n\\\\n[E] Knowledge derived from personal experience, ie the expert\\\\u2019s training and\\\\nprofessional experience in their forensic specialism.\\\\n\\\\nPublished scientific data are used wherever possible as a basis for these assessments.\\\\nIf relevant published data are not available, then data from unpublished sources or\\\\nad hoc experiments may be used as long as they have been peer reviewed and\\\\ndocumented on file. Knowledge such as personal experience in similar cases and\\\\npeer consultations may be used provided that the practitioner can justify their use\\\\nand demonstrate their basis 15 . In addition to the nature of the knowledge invoked, it\\\\nis critically important that the expert discloses transparently the nature, provenance,\\\\nextent and relevancy of the knowledge used to inform their LR. Transparency is\\\\nparamount to ensure scrutiny and ultimately to allow courts to assess credibility, ie\\\\nhow LRs were derived and their robustness. Because LRs may be based on different\\\\nexperts\\\\u2019 knowledge, there may be a legitimate and understandable difference in opinion\\\\nbetween two experts.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThese developments will require improvements to the content of expert reports, to\\\\nthe competence of counsel to understand such reports and interrogate experts and to\\\\nthe ability of the judiciary to handle such evidence appropriately. These improvements\\\\nwill require actions by many stakeholders, including the Forensic Science Regulator\\\\nto set standards for reporting, the academic and professional bodies to agree that the\\\\neducation of legal professionals should include dealing with scientific evidence, and\\\\ntraining related to scientific evidence and its evaluation within the judicial colleges.\\\\n\\\\nThe lack of a common language among experts, lawyers, judges and lay people\\\\nabout what is meant by probability and statistics and how these concepts are used\\\\nby experts to provide answers to specific case-related questions remains challenging.\\\\nThis can lead to misunderstandings and confusion.\\\\n\\\\nThere are also gaps in data and knowledge related to many types of evidence, including\\\\nhow materials transfer between people and between people and surfaces. Similarly,\\\\ndata on the persistence of materials once transferred and on background abundance\\\\nof materials are sparse. This requires a greater reliance on the expert\\\\u2019s knowledge and\\\\nunderstanding of evidence and applying this to specific case circumstances.\\\\n\\\\nIn some circumstances where data are well known and well defined (eg repetitive\\\\nmeasurements made by a scientific instrument) significance testing (Appendix 4) can\\\\nbe undertaken to provide a fundamental tool in uncovering relevant information about\\\\nthe data and what inferences can be made. An example may be the measurement\\\\nof uncertainty or error relating to the determination of alcohol or drugs in a sample.\\\\nConcepts such as causation and relative risk (Appendix 5) can be explored with the help\\\\nof statistical methods; however, the significance of such associations remains primarily a\\\\nmatter of expert judgement.\\\\n\\\\nThis primer forms only a basic introduction to the evaluation of evidence based on\\\\nstatistical and probabilistic reasoning.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n## Appendix 1: The use of probability\\\\n\\\\n**Probability in a legal context**\\\\nWith the exception of evidence that is eliminative, scientific findings rarely provide\\\\nevidence that is conclusive for a particular questioned event. The probative value of\\\\nscientific findings needs to be assessed and taken into account by the fact-finders when\\\\nconsidering whether a contested event in the past, for example whether the defendant\\\\ncommitted the offence, is true. The notion of probability applies not only to the ultimate\\\\nquestion but also to intermediate questions, such as: What is the probability that the\\\\ndefendant grabbed the victim\\\\u2019s (complainer in Scotland) clothing at the relevant time?\\\\n\\\\nIn criminal cases, the fact-finder must believe beyond reasonable doubt and be sure\\\\nthat the event occurred. There have been attempts to define what \\\\u2018beyond reasonable\\\\ndoubt\\\\u2019 and to \\\\u2018be sure\\\\u2019 mean in numerical, probabilistic terms but there is no agreement\\\\non, or even a strong drive to adopt, a particular number.\\\\n\\\\nIn contrast, the fact-finder in civil cases relies on the concept of balance of probabilities.\\\\nOne common understanding is that the fact-finder must form a judgement, based on the\\\\nstrength of the evidence, as to whether their belief for the plaintiff\\\\u2019s contention is greater\\\\nthan or less than 50%. The notion of probability may also be invoked in court when\\\\nexpert evidence is being adduced.\\\\n\\\\nAs an example, suppose the court is being presented with evidence of a particular\\\\nbloodstain pattern in a case of assault. The expert testifies that it is \\\\u201bhighly probable\\\\u2019\\\\nthe bloodstain pattern would be observed on the defendant\\\\u2019s shoes if the defendant\\\\nhad, as alleged, kicked the victim. The notion here is of \\\\u201bobservations\\\\u2019 and expert\\\\nexpectations of observing material/analytical results, etc if a proposition were true rather\\\\nthan to discuss the \\\\u2018cause\\\\u2019 of the bloodstain pattern. Discussion of \\\\u2018cause\\\\u2019 requires the\\\\ngeneration of explanations after the observations have been made.\\\\n\\\\nTo avoid possible confusion, the expert should explain to the court that \\\\u201bhighly probable\\\\u2019\\\\nis a description of their expectation that this particular pattern of bloodstaining on the\\\\ndefendant\\\\u2019s shoes would have been observed if the defendant had, as alleged, kicked\\\\nthe victim. But, for balance, it is necessary also to ask: What is the probability that this\\\\npattern of bloodstaining would have been observed if the defendant had not kicked the\\\\nvictim? The answer to this second question may be, for example, \\\\u201bvery low\\\\u2019.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThese assignments are the expert\\\'s probability judgements made after taking into\\\\naccount the results of any experimentation aligned to the case circumstances, the body\\\\nof documented knowledge and data in the specialism, as well as their own experience\\\\nin the field. There are no such things as the \\\\u201bright\\\\u2019 or \\\\u201bcorrect\\\\u2019 probabilities in this case.\\\\n\\\\n**Expert explanations, or expressions of possibility**\\\\nThere is a form of expert opinion that does not involve assessment of probability and is\\\\nclassified 16 as an explanation (possibility). Phrases that an expert will use to express an\\\\nexplanation include \\\\u201bconsistent with\\\\u2019, \\\\u201bcould have\\\\u2019 and \\\\u201bcannot exclude\\\\u2019. For example,\\\\nthe expert may explain that \\\\u201cthe finding of a fibre on the clothing of a suspect which\\\\nis indistinguishable from fibres of the complainer\\\\u2019s clothing could be the result of\\\\nsecondary rather than primary transfer\\\\u201d. Such explanations, however, are generally\\\\nunhelpful for fact-finders when deciding on the truth of a contested event because\\\\nmerely presenting explanations bears the potential of suggesting that the expert is\\\\nopining directly on the probability of the competing versions of the event rather than on\\\\nthe value of the findings within the framework of circumstances of the alleged activities.\\\\n\\\\nExplanations may offer assistance during the investigative proceedings but are\\\\nlimited insofar as there is no assessment of the probative value of the findings. The\\\\nexplanations may not be an exhaustive list of possibilities and there is no assessment\\\\nof how probable each explanation may be, rendering them generally not useful for\\\\ndecision-making. However, while exploring alternative explanations (causes) for the\\\\nevidence is a perfectly valid procedure before a trial, questions about alternative\\\\nexplanations may be posed later in court by defence counsel to dilute the force of\\\\nthe principal conclusions.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**The basis for assigning probabilities**\\\\nAll probability assignments can be viewed as being conditioned on some form of\\\\npre-existing information. That information could include relevant details of the\\\\ncircumstances of the case in question, actuarial data, technical data, expert knowledge,\\\\nresults of competency testing, etc. It is important for all those people who use and rely\\\\non probability assignments to understand the notion of conditioning.\\\\n\\\\nIt is important for the people who make probability assignments to declare the\\\\nconditioning factors that have influenced those assignments \\\\u2013 and it is important for the\\\\nrecipients of expert information to probe the foundations of those declarations. It is also\\\\nvital that the fact-finder is made fully aware of those influences. The type and quantity\\\\nof conditioning information taken into account will vary depending on, first, the role of\\\\nthe person assigning the probability within the fact-finding process and, second, the\\\\nquestion being asked.\\\\n\\\\nFor some roles and some types of question, the basis for assigning a probability may be\\\\nstraightforward, but for others assigning a probability may be problematic because of a\\\\nlack of knowledge or a lack of relevant data or because it is not within the competence\\\\nof the person being asked the question. Case studies 2 and 3 provide two examples in\\\\na criminal context to illustrate the sources of expert probability assignments.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**CASE STUDY 2**\\\\n\\\\nA DNA case\\\\n\\\\nThe fact-finder is presented with expert evidence of matching DNA profiles extracted\\\\nfrom a sample from a defendant and from a bloodstain left at the scene of a crime.\\\\nA question for the fact-finder would be: Is the DNA extracted and analysed from\\\\nthe bloodstain that of the defendant? And the ultimate question would be: Is the\\\\ndefendant guilty of an offence? It is the fact-finder\\\\u2019s role to answer the two questions.\\\\nWhether they do so probabilistically is entirely their choice. It is not the expert\\\\u2019s role\\\\nto answer the two questions, however tempting it may be to answer the first question.\\\\nWhat the expert can do is to provide the fact-finder with their expert, justified view on\\\\nthe probability of observing the DNA evidence, ie DNA profile from the bloodstain and\\\\nthe defendant\\\\u2019s DNA profile, under two competing propositions. If we look at the first\\\\nquestion, the pair of competing propositions would be:\\\\n\\\\n-  Hp (the prosecution proposition): The DNA originated from the defendant.\\\\n\\\\n-  Hd (the defence proposition): The DNA originated from someone unrelated to\\\\nthe defendant .\\\\n\\\\nThe expert can help the fact-finder by providing their probability of obtaining the DNA\\\\nevidence if the DNA had originated from the defendant and, alternatively, if it had\\\\noriginated from someone unrelated to the defendant.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe first probability assignment, ie the probability of obtaining the DNA\\\\nevidence if the DNA from the scene had come from the defendant, would be\\\\nbased on the expert\\\\u2019s knowledge of the reliability of the process of DNA profiling\\\\nin producing the true profile from a stain. The expert should base their assessment\\\\non whatever relevant data there may be. Turning to the alternative proposition,\\\\nadditional considerations for assigning a probability of the DNA evidence come\\\\ninto play. Under the proposition that the DNA had originated from someone\\\\nunrelated to the defendant, the probability of obtaining a match with the defendant\\\\ndepends additionally on the proportion of individuals who have this DNA type in\\\\nthe relevant population.\\\\n\\\\nThere are databases of DNA profiles from samples of people from various\\\\nethnic groupings. These databases can be consulted to assess the rarity of the\\\\n(matching) DNA profile. That statistic can then be used as a basis, among other\\\\nconsiderations (such as genetic relationships among individuals), for assigning a\\\\nprobability of obtaining a match IF the bloodstaining had originated from someone\\\\nunrelated to the defendant. What the expert brings to that assignment is knowledge\\\\nand understanding of the impact of relatedness among people, in the form of a\\\\npopulation-genetic model, and of choosing the most relevant database(s) for the case\\\\nin question. It is not just a simple question of using a frequency of occurrence as a\\\\nprobability: a more subtle treatment is required.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**CASE STUDY 3**\\\\n\\\\nA firearm discharge residue case\\\\n\\\\nA person has been accused of discharging a firearm during the commission of a\\\\nrobbery. The firearm was not recovered but spent cartridge cases were found at the\\\\nscene. Swabs were taken from the hands of the defendant about five hours after\\\\nthe incident. Subsequent chemical analysis of the swabs revealed the presence of a\\\\nsmall amount of firearm discharge residue (FDR, also called a gunshot residue, GSR)\\\\nthat had the same qualitative composition as the reference FDR recovered from the\\\\ncartridge cases.\\\\n\\\\nThe fact-finder\\\\u2019s questions would include: Did the FDR on the defendant\\\\u2019s hand\\\\nswabs come from the gun that fired the cartridges? And: What is the probability that\\\\nthe defendant fired the gun, given matching FDR had been found? The expert\\\\u2019s\\\\nrole is to offer probabilities for observing the particular FDR, given the truth of the\\\\nprosecution proposition and defence alternative that flow from the questions facing\\\\nthe fact-finder. Looking at the issue of whether the defendant fired the gun, the two\\\\ncompeting propositions would be:\\\\n\\\\n-  Hp: The defendant fired the gun (at the relevant time).\\\\n\\\\n-  Hd: The defendant did not fire the gun (it was some other person).\\\\n\\\\nNote that, for a sensible definition of the alternative proposition, it is relevant to\\\\nenquire, if possible, about what the defendant says. There may be situations in\\\\nwhich the defendant asserts that he was a bystander, or that he provided first aid to\\\\nthe victim. These details are relevant to help specify the alternative proposition and\\\\ntask-relevant conditioning information. Defining the alternative proposition as the\\\\nsimple negation of the prosecution\\\\u2019s proposition is usually not sufficient. The expert\\\\nshould be able to offer probabilities for obtaining the FDR evidence given the truth\\\\nof these propositions.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe task to be addressed is that the propositions are contested \\\\u2013 we do not know\\\\nwhich of the competing propositions is true. Did the defendant or someone else fire\\\\nthe gun? The principles of inductive logic (where the conclusion may be probable\\\\nbased upon the evidence presented) dictate that, to assess the probability that an\\\\nuncertain proposition is true, the probabilities of the evidence under the competing\\\\npropositions need to be considered (see Section 2.5 on doping). So, how does the\\\\nexpert assign such probabilities?\\\\n\\\\nUnder the first proposition\\\\nThe defendant fired the gun (at the relevant time): the expert would rely on whatever\\\\nis known generally about transfer and persistence of FDR and apply that knowledge\\\\nto assign a probability for obtaining the evidence under this proposition. The expert\\\\nmay consider undertaking experiments to replicate as far as possible the conditions\\\\nof the incident, to provide more data and knowledge. The probability that they assign\\\\nwill be their best assessment of the probability of obtaining the evidence. Other\\\\nexperts may disagree with the assignment but, with transparent communication and\\\\nexplanation, the expert should be able to demonstrate and justify how they arrived\\\\nat a particular probability.\\\\n\\\\nUnder the alternative proposition\\\\nThe defendant did not fire the gun (at a relevant time, it was some other person):\\\\nthe expert would use whatever survey or other data there may be to help them\\\\nconsider the probability of obtaining the evidence under this proposition, and given\\\\nthe task-relevant information. Again, this will be the expert\\\\u2019s considered view on that\\\\nprobability. Generally, the body of knowledge upon which the expert relies should be\\\\navailable for auditing and disclosure.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**How do we know if the expert\\\\u2019s probability assignments are reliable?**\\\\nThe answer to that lies, first, in the expert being able to explain in a transparent\\\\nway the basis of their assignment and, second, in the expert revealing the results\\\\nof any relevant calibration of their past opinions through, for example, competency\\\\ntesting. The expert should be able to defend their opinion upon challenge. Through\\\\ntransparency and effective explanation on the part of the expert, the fact-finder should\\\\nbe able to understand the basis of the declared probabilities and take a view on how\\\\nto incorporate the expert\\\\u2019s opinion in the fact-finder\\\\u2019s own reasoning process.\\\\n\\\\n**How may experts use probability to assist fact-finders in their decision-making?**\\\\nIt is important for all participants in the justice process to understand and be clear\\\\nabout several key issues and questions in the use of probability. These are:\\\\n\\\\n-  The essential distinction between probabilities for evidence (usually the expert\\\\u2019s\\\\nobservations and analytical results) and probabilities for propositions (ie the facts\\\\nin issue).\\\\n\\\\n-  Whether probabilities for propositions are being assigned before or after expert\\\\nevidence is presented. If before the consideration of expert evidence, these\\\\nprobabilities are called prior probabilities; if after the presentation of expert evidence,\\\\nthey are called posterior probabilities (see Section 2.5 on the doping example).\\\\n\\\\n-  Who is best placed, in terms of their roles in the legal process, to provide these\\\\ndifferent types of probability?\\\\n\\\\n-  What is the information that has conditioned (or influenced) the assignment of\\\\nprobabilities to the propositions, and is it relevant to the task?\\\\n\\\\nGenerally, the probabilities for obtaining expert observations, conditioned on the truth\\\\nor otherwise of the proposition in question, are in the domain of the experts. The expert\\\\nshould have sufficient data and the knowledge and understanding of the evidence to\\\\nassign defensible, informed probabilities. The expert should be able to convey and\\\\nexplain these probabilities to the fact-finder to help them deliberate on the truth or\\\\nfalsehood of the proposition in question. It is the fact-finder who has received other,\\\\nnon-expert evidence in a case and who is therefore in the best position to take a view\\\\non the truth of the proposition in question. However, this is not a hard-and-fast rule and\\\\nthere will be some situations in which the expert can provide informed probabilities for\\\\nthe truth of the proposition.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**What are the limitations of using probability?**\\\\nPerhaps the main limitation is the lack of a common understanding among experts,\\\\nlawyers, judges and lay people of the notion of probability and the extent\\\\nto which it can be applied. Until there is a shared understanding and a common\\\\nlanguage about probability, and an agreement on how best to express probability,\\\\nthen misunderstandings and confusion will occur, resulting in expert evidence being\\\\nvalued inappropriately or perhaps ruled as inadmissible when it might be helpful and\\\\nvalid. Even among experts, there is misunderstanding about, and a variation in, the\\\\nadoption of probability. In the field of DNA profiling, practitioners use probabilistic\\\\nsoftware for the logical interpretation of complex DNA mixtures. Without such software,\\\\nthe interpretation of such mixtures would be very difficult. Discussion of the potential\\\\nand limitations of such software is provided in Forensic DNA analysis: a primer for\\\\nthe courts 17 . In other fields, however, practitioners are only just beginning to explore\\\\nprobabilistic thinking. The Royal Statistical Society and the Inns of Court College\\\\nof Advocates have together produced guidance on the use of probability 18 that\\\\nprovides a good starting point.\\\\n\\\\nAnother limitation is the lack of relevant data to inform probabilities in some areas of\\\\nexpertise. In some areas, such as in textile fibres and \\\\u201btouch\\\\u2019 DNA, there is an extensive\\\\nbody of research and survey data on which to draw. In other areas, such as toolmarks\\\\nor ballistics, there is only limited published research on important considerations\\\\nrelevant for assessing probative value. In the absence of reliable, informative and\\\\nstructured data, the expert must rely on their knowledge and understanding of the\\\\nevidence type, provided that the basis of such opinion is documented, can be audited\\\\nand is disclosed. It is in such areas particularly that evidence of the reliability of the\\\\nexpert\\\\u2019s opinions would be highly desirable.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n## Appendix 2: Evaluation of trace evidence\\\\n\\\\nTrace evidence refers to any material that is transferred between persons or objects\\\\nduring contact and is commonly recovered in connection with an alleged crime. The\\\\nterm is often used to refer to the collection of materials frequently encountered by\\\\nforensic scientists such as glass, paint, fibres, firearm discharge residue and DNA.\\\\n\\\\nIn forensic casework, the objective is often to compare known material and questioned\\\\nmaterial. Either can originate from the suspect or from the scene. Examples include\\\\nglass from a window compared with glass fragments recovered from a suspect or fibres\\\\nfrom a suspect\\\\u2019s jumper compared with recovered fibres from a victim. The material\\\\nmight be compared at the source level (eg are the fragments from the same window or\\\\nnot?) or at the activity level (eg did the suspect break the window or not?). Source level\\\\nis rarely sufficient to assist the questions relevant to the case. Glass recovered from\\\\na suspect that is indistinguishable from a broken window is of little value without an\\\\nassessment of how probable such a finding is if the suspect broke the window versus\\\\nthat the suspect had nothing to do with the breaking.\\\\n\\\\nIn order to tackle the question of source, forensic laboratory analysis is typically\\\\nundertaken to measure different features or characteristics of the known and\\\\nquestioned material. To interpret the weight of the evidence (or likelihood ratio (LR))\\\\nwhen comparing material at the source-level usually requires evaluating the similarity\\\\nof the features of the two sets of material (how closely they match each other based on\\\\nthe analysis undertaken) and the rarity of the observed features. The rarer the features\\\\nobserved, the stronger the evidence may be. See Appendix 3 for more details on\\\\nsource-level comparisons.\\\\n\\\\nAnalysing trace evidence at the source level alone, without reference to the activities\\\\nassociated with the evidence, can be misleading. It is often the case that the most\\\\nrelevant questions are related to the activities which may have led to the trace\\\\nmaterials being transferred. In order to obtain results that are helpful to address these\\\\nquestions and that are not misleading, other factors need to be considered in addition\\\\nto the source-level questions. These other factors include the probabilities of transfer,\\\\npersistence and recovery of the material in the context of the alleged activities.\\\\nStatistical approaches which only assess the similarity and rarity of the materials can\\\\nmiss factors which affect relevance within the context of the circumstances of a given\\\\ncase \\\\u2013 this can have a major impact on the evidential weight of the findings.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nTrace evidence must be viewed in the context of the case. As described in Section\\\\n2, at least two competing propositions should be addressed. In addressing these for\\\\na specific case, the expert considers how probable the findings are in each of these\\\\ncompeting propositions. The result is presented in the form of an LR. This highlights\\\\nthat the results do not have a stand-alone value; rather, their value is dependent on the\\\\nproposition being addressed or the questions to be answered.\\\\n\\\\nThe issues to be considered to address activity-level propositions are similar for all\\\\ntrace materials but the factors affecting the issues vary from one material to another.\\\\nTo assess how probable it is to find matching materials (glass, fibres, etc) if a particular\\\\naction took place, data on transfer, persistence and recovery are needed as well as data\\\\non how common the materials under consideration are in the environment. Levels of\\\\nbackground abundance are also needed when considering the findings if the alternative\\\\nis true, ie that the activity did not take place or was not carried out by the suspect.\\\\nAn example is knowing the background abundance of groups of glass fragments which\\\\nwould be found on clothing in a given population. Sometimes, where insufficient data\\\\nare available, expert judgement or personal opinion are used to assign the required\\\\nprobabilities. This should be made explicit in the report. Ideally ad hoc experiments\\\\nshould be carried out in the absence of data.\\\\n\\\\n**Assumptions and data**\\\\nWhen evaluating LRs for trace evidence, statistical assumptions are needed both at\\\\nthe source level and at the activity level. For example, it may be assumed that the\\\\ndistribution of measurements follows a particular statistical model or that two events\\\\nthat are alleged to have occurred are statistically independent of one another. These\\\\nassumptions will depend on the type of evidence and the competing propositions being\\\\nconsidered. For some evidence types and propositions, the statistical assumptions are\\\\nwell understood and validated. For others the methods are less well developed. When\\\\nanalysing evidence at the activity level, propositions can be very case dependent. As\\\\na result, the statistical approaches and datasets used to evaluate the evidence may be\\\\nbased on the personal judgement of the forensic expert.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nWhere any statistical assumptions or datasets have been used to evaluate evidence,\\\\nthese should be clearly explained and justified in the case report. It is important that\\\\nchecks have been carried out to test whether the statistical assumptions used are\\\\nappropriate for the evidence type and the propositions being assessed. One way of\\\\ndoing this is to test the statistical approach on an existing dataset where the ground\\\\ntruth is known and to assess the proportion of times that the LR gives a misleading\\\\nor incorrect result.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, for a source-level comparison this would mean evaluating the proportion\\\\nof times that the LR is greater than 1 when the two sets of material are from different\\\\nsources and the proportion of times that the LR is less than 1 when the two sets of\\\\nmaterial are from the same source. Both proportions should be small in a model that\\\\nfits the evidence type for which it is being used.\\\\n\\\\n**Fibres**\\\\nFibres are shed from surfaces of various materials such as clothing, carpets\\\\nand car seats. They vary greatly in composition and colour. Studies have found that\\\\nfibres which are common, such as blue wool, have not been detected on surfaces\\\\nin high numbers except in areas where a known source has been in contact. Hence,\\\\nfibres can be very useful in reconstructing the activities that occurred during the contact\\\\nbetween textiles. The tendency to shed fibres is governed by many factors, including\\\\nthe looseness of the weave, the size of the fibres and the age of the garment. This is\\\\neasy to visualise when we consider the difference between the shedding of a new\\\\ncarpet and that of one that has been in place for some time.\\\\n\\\\nWhether fibres transfer or not depends on the shedability and on the type of contact.\\\\nInformation on both factors is needed to assess the range of fibres likely to be\\\\ntransferred. A smooth shell suit will not be expected to yield transferred fibres even\\\\nif the contact is prolonged while a woollen jumper will give rise to transferred fibres\\\\nwith limited contact. Little peer reviewed published literature exists in relation to the\\\\nshedability of fibres. These considerations highlight why case context is important\\\\nin assigning the probabilities of the findings in competing scenarios. Fibres are best\\\\nconsidered in the totality of the case and it is rarely useful to consider only their\\\\nsources or the presence of a single fibre.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nTransfers of fibres can be by direct contact (eg from the suspect\\\\u2019s clothes to the\\\\nvictim\\\\u2019s clothes) or by indirect contact (eg fibres transferred from the victim\\\\u2019s clothes\\\\nto the suspect\\\\u2019s clothes via an intermediary object); the latter is called secondary\\\\ntransfer. It is not possible for the expert to opine on whether the transfer of fibres was\\\\nprimary or secondary transfer, or whether or not the transfer occurred during the alleged\\\\nactivity. However, fibre experts are well placed to assess the probability of particular\\\\nfindings in either scenario.\\\\n\\\\nExample 1: competing sources of fibres\\\\nA sexual assault is reported as having taken place in the bedroom of a residence.\\\\nThis is denied by the suspect, who alleges that consensual sex occurred in the living\\\\nroom and that he never entered the bedroom. Fibres are an ideal evidence type to\\\\nhelp distinguish between these two scenarios. For example, a large number of fibres\\\\nindistinguishable from the bedcover would be expected to be recovered from the\\\\nsuspect\\\\u2019s socks and fibres indistinguishable from the socks and the bedcover would be\\\\nexpected to be recovered from the victim if the assault took place in the bedroom.\\\\n\\\\nA large number of fibres indistinguishable from the bedcover would not be expected\\\\nto be recovered from the suspect\\\\u2019s socks given the alternative scenario. In this case, the\\\\nLR (ie the weight to be assigned to the findings) would involve the relative consideration\\\\nof these probabilities and the pair of competing propositions would be:\\\\n\\\\n-  Hp: The assault took place in the bedroom.\\\\n\\\\n-  Hd: Consensual sex took place in the living room.\\\\n\\\\nGiven the above assignments, if a large number of matching fibres were obtained,\\\\nwe would expect a value of the LR above 1, supporting the proposition that the\\\\nassault occurred in the bedroom. The actual values for the probabilities will depend on\\\\nfactors such as the tendency of the socks and the bedcover to shed fibres, the time\\\\nbetween the incident and the seizure and examination of the items, the frequency of\\\\noccurrence of fibre types in given situations and the statistical assumptions used to\\\\nlink these factors together. The number of recovered indistinguishable fibres from the\\\\nbedcover are relevant because it is possible that a small number of bedcover fibres\\\\nmay be present in the living room. Much of this becomes a matter of professional\\\\njudgement and experience.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nExample 2: missing fibre types\\\\nIn an alleged assault, the victim (complainer in Scotland) is wearing a green T-shirt\\\\nand the suspect a red football supporter\\\\u2019s jersey. The jersey is found to consist of a\\\\nrange of coloured polyester and cotton fibres. Shedding tests show that the fibres\\\\nshed in roughly equal proportions. The red polyester fibres recovered from the victim\\\\u2019s\\\\nT-shirt are found to be indistinguishable from the suspect\\\\u2019s jersey but no cotton fibres\\\\nare recovered. No green fibres matching the victim\\\\u2019s T-shirt are recovered from the\\\\nsuspect\\\\u2019s jersey. Here we have an example of the findings not fitting the expectations\\\\nin the context of the case. The pair of competing propositions would be:\\\\n\\\\n-  Hp: The suspect grappled with the victim at a given time.\\\\n\\\\n-  Hd: The suspect never had any contact with the victim.\\\\n\\\\nWith the information above, the expert will inform that the findings are unlikely given Hp\\\\nbut more expected given Hd. The LR will be less than 1, ie supporting Hd.\\\\n\\\\nThis example is designed to highlight the necessity of considering the findings in\\\\ncompeting scenarios and considering the context of the case. The matching red fibres\\\\nviewed in isolation are misleading no matter how robust the analytical tests applied or\\\\nhow rare are the fibre types.\\\\n\\\\n**Glass**\\\\nWhen a window is broken a large number of fragments fall back in the direction of the\\\\nblow. Thus, a person delivering the blow is expected to have small fragments in their\\\\nhair or on the surface of their clothing depending on how close they were to the window\\\\nas it was breaking, the height of the window, the type of glass and the activities that\\\\nfollowed 19 . One of the main tests used to examine glass fragments at the source level\\\\nconsists of measuring the refractive index, which varies both within a pane of glass\\\\nand between sources of glass. The refractive indices of the glass fragments from the\\\\nwindow are measured and glass fragments from the suspect are also analysed and put\\\\ninto matching and non-matching groups of glass if glass of more than one refractive\\\\nindex is present 20 . However, assessing the closeness of the \\\\u2018match\\\\u2019 between glass\\\\nrecovered from clothing and the window glass does not provide sufficient information\\\\nto evaluate propositions concerning whether or not the suspect broke the window.\\\\nEven when additional analytical tests are applied, this activity-related question is not\\\\nanswered. Other information is required relating to, for example, how glass fragments\\\\nare transferred and retained following the breaking of glass objects, or how prevalent\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nglass fragments are on surfaces not directly connected to a recent break.\\\\nGlass fragments can be exchanged following a large range of daily activities.\\\\n\\\\nTo evaluate the glass fragment results, information is needed on how probable the\\\\nfindings are if the suspect broke the window(s) against how probable the findings\\\\nare if the suspect had nothing to do with breaking the window(s). To address the first\\\\nprobability, two possible ways that the glass fragments can arise must be considered\\\\n\\\\u2013 either fragments were transferred when the window was broken and non-matching\\\\nglass, if present, was already on the clothing or no glass was transferred from the\\\\nwindow and all the glass on the clothing, both matching and non-matching, was\\\\nalready there. To assess the probability of the findings (ie glass matching the window\\\\nfound on the clothing), if the suspect had nothing to do with breaking the glass, we\\\\nneed information on the probability of finding glass on innocent members of the\\\\npopulation. This information is critical, and it is useful to consider a population as close\\\\nto the suspect as possible. One well-known dataset considers glass on the clothing of\\\\npersons who come to the attention of the police rather than the general population.\\\\n\\\\n**Firearm discharge residue (FDR)**\\\\nFDR is a combination of small particles produced when a gun is fired following the\\\\nexplosion in the barrel. This evidence type is complicated, consisting of a non-uniform\\\\npopulation of particles which includes so-called \\\\u2018unique\\\\u2019 particles containing lead,\\\\nbarium and antimony. However, to be considered FDR, other characteristic particles\\\\nalso need to be present. Accepting this means that a single particle is not FDR.\\\\n\\\\nDifferent ammunitions give rise to different residues, but a very high number have\\\\nsimilar compositions providing little discrimination. Even when the ammunition type is\\\\nknown, it is considered good practice to compare residue from the discharged cartridge\\\\ncase, barrel of the gun or the bullet hole \\\\u2013 the known material(s) \\\\u2013 and the residue\\\\nrecovered from the hands or clothing of the suspect \\\\u2013 the questioned material(s). This is\\\\nbecause variation in the proportions of particles can occur. It is common to see reports\\\\nfrom forensic scientists in which the number of particles recovered is factually reported,\\\\nor a statement that FDR was detected. Such statements can often be accompanied by\\\\na disclaimer that the findings are \\\\u2018consistent with\\\\u2019 the suspect being close to a person\\\\nfiring the gun or touching a surface with firearm residue on it. Similarly, a negative\\\\nfinding is explained away by loss or time delay. The evaluation of the meaning of such\\\\nfindings in the context of the case is generally left out of the report.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nHowever, as with other trace evidence types, the more relevant question is whether\\\\nor not the suspect undertook an activity which could result in the scientific findings. In\\\\nthe case of FDR, it is more meaningful to address whether the findings are more or less\\\\nlikely if the person fired or did not fire the gun in the circumstances of the case. These\\\\nassessments will go beyond statements of consistency but should be qualified\\\\nin terms of probability.\\\\n\\\\nExample\\\\nIn a given set of circumstances, the expert may indicate that the probability of finding\\\\nFDR on a person who fired a gun is high if the person is sampled soon after the gun had\\\\nbeen fired. That expectation will be balanced against the probability of the finding if the\\\\nsuspect did not fire the gun. The latter probability is low as surveys on members of the\\\\ngeneral population show few instances of FDR. Depending on the circumstances, finding\\\\nFDR on a person\\\\u2019s hands is expected to provide support for firing of a gun rather than not\\\\nfiring a gun, ie the LR will be greater than 1.\\\\n\\\\nTo inform these probabilities and assign a meaningful LR, information is needed on the\\\\ntype of weapon and length of time between the alleged firing and sampling. Ideally, tests\\\\nshould be carried out under the conditions of the known circumstances of the case.\\\\nData regarding the presence of FDR as a background in a given population (of individuals\\\\nor objects) is also required to assess how prevalent the material may be considering\\\\nactivities other than discharging a firearm. At the current time the understanding of the\\\\ntransfer, persistence, recovery and background abundance of FDR is limited.\\\\n\\\\n**Drugs on banknotes**\\\\nBanknotes seized from people who have been found guilty of drug crime on average\\\\nhave higher levels of drug contamination than banknotes found in general circulation.\\\\nDifferent analytical techniques can be used to obtain measurements of drug traces\\\\non banknotes and can result in different measurements. Hence it is important that\\\\ncomparisons are made using datasets obtained using the same analytical technique. For\\\\nsome drugs (eg cocaine, which is found on most banknotes) the measurements of drug\\\\nfound on the set of seized banknotes are related to the quantities of drug on the notes.\\\\nFor other drugs (such as heroin) the measurements might simply be the presence or\\\\nabsence of the drug on each banknote.\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe strength of this evidence in relation to the following propositions can be evaluated\\\\nusing an LR and the pair of competing propositions would be:\\\\n\\\\n-  Hp: The banknotes are associated with a person involved in drug crime.\\\\n\\\\n-  Hd: The banknotes are from general circulation.\\\\n\\\\nStatistical models can be used to evaluate the LR; for some examples, see Wilson\\\\n_et al._ 21 . The assumptions behind the statistical models must be checked and the\\\\nmodels validated. Selecting suitable databases for these statistical models can be a\\\\nchallenge 22 as there may be both regional variations and variations over time associated\\\\nwith particular drug use behaviours in different areas. Having relevant localised\\\\nground truth data (analysed samples from known locations over different known time\\\\nperiods) is essential to assess whether this is the case. It is important that the datasets\\\\nare consistent with the propositions. For example, if the propositions are specific\\\\nto a particular drug, then the dataset should also be specific to that drug over the\\\\nappropriate time period. It is also difficult to obtain a dataset of banknotes \\\\u201bassociated\\\\nwith a person involved in drug crime\\\\u2019, which can make it difficult to estimate the\\\\nprobability of the findings under Hp. It is therefore key that the statistical assumptions\\\\nsupporting data selection are described and justified.\\\\n\\\\nMany of the general guidelines described in the four scenarios presented\\\\nabove are applicable to other types of evidence. The same can be said of the\\\\nchallenges posed by the limited availability of ground truth databases and lack of\\\\nexperimental studies for estimating transfer, persistence and recovery probabilities\\\\nfor most types of trace",\\n    "metadata": {\\n      "content_elapsed": 1529.0,\\n      "readability_elapsed": null,\\n      "markdown_elapsed": 8422.0,\\n      "text_elapsed": null,\\n      "summarize_elapsed": null,\\n      "cached": null\\n    },\\n    "published_date": "1756449714.482192"\\n  }\\n]\') </scrape-webpage> </tool_result>'}
