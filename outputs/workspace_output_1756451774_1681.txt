It is designed to ensure thorough examination of potential prejudice in legal proceedings while maximizing the use of record citations and authoritative sources.

## II. DEFINING LEGAL PREJUDICE

### A. Legal Definitions and Standards

1. **Statutory Definitions**
   - 28 U.S.C. ยง 455(a): "Any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned."
   - 28 U.S.C. ยง 455(b)(1): Disqualification required where the judge "has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding."
   - 28 U.S.C. ยง 144: Requires disqualification for "personal bias or prejudice" upon filing of a sufficient affidavit.

2. **Judicial Interpretations**
   - *Liteky v. United States*, 510 U.S. 540 (1994): Established the "extrajudicial source" doctrine, holding that bias or prejudice must typically stem from an extrajudicial source to warrant disqualification.
   - *Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.*, 556 U.S. 868 (2009): Established that due process requires judicial recusal when "the probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable."
   - *Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp.*, 486 U.S. 847 (1988): Clarified that ยง 455(a) requires disqualification based on appearance of partiality, even if the judge was unaware of the disqualifying circumstance.
