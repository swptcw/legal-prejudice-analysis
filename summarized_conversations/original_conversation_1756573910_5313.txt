{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "<function_calls>\n<ask>\nI'll start with updating the main website and fixing the links. Let me create the necessary files for this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current structure of the main website. I see that there's an index.html file in the repository, but I should examine it to understand its structure before making changes.\n\nWould you like me to:\n\n1. Create a completely new design for the main website based on the current content at legal-prejudice-analysis.org\n2. Update the existing index.html in the repository with corrected links and improved design\n3. Make minimal changes to the existing site, focusing only on fixing the links\n\nAlso, for the DNS configuration of subdomains, would you prefer:\n- I provide you with the exact DNS records you need to add\n- I create the CNAME files in the repository and you'll handle the DNS configuration\n- We work on the subdomain implementation after fixing the main website\n\nLet me know which approach you prefer, and I'll get started immediately.\n</ask>\n</function_calls>", 'tool_calls': None}
