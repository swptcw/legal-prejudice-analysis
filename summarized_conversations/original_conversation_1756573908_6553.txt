{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<function_calls>\n<ask>\nI\'ve examined the GitHub repository and the website at legal-prejudice-analysis.org. Now I understand what we need to do to get the links working properly. Here\'s my implementation plan:\n\n## Current Status\n1. The website is successfully deployed at legal-prejudice-analysis.org using GitHub Pages\n2. The GitHub repository is at https://github.com/swptcw/legal-prejudice-analysis\n3. The website has placeholder links that need to be updated\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1. Fix GitHub Repository Links\nAll GitHub links on the website currently point to "yourusername/legal-prejudice-analysis" and need to be updated to "swptcw/legal-prejudice-analysis"\n\n### 2. Create Subdomain Structure\nWe have several options for implementing the subdomains:\n- **Option A**: Create actual subdomains (docs.legal-prejudice-analysis.org, demo.legal-prejudice-analysis.org)\n- **Option B**: Create subdirectories within the main site (/docs/, /demo/)\n\n### 3. Priority Pages to Implement\n1. **Documentation Hub** (/docs/)\n   - Convert markdown files to HTML\n   - Create navigation structure\n   - Implement search functionality\n\n2. **Interactive Calculator Demo** (/demo/)\n   - Deploy the risk calculator\n   - Add sample cases\n   - Implement visualization components\n\n3. **Downloads Page** (/downloads/)\n   - Create download links for components\n   - Add version information\n   - Include installation instructions\n\n4. **Integration Guides** (/integration/)\n   - Create guides for each CMS system\n   - Add API documentation\n   - Include code examples\n\n### Questions:\n1. Would you prefer to use actual subdomains or subdirectories?\n2. Do you have access to update DNS settings for creating subdomains?\n3. Should we implement the changes directly in the GitHub repository or work locally first?\n4. Which page would you like me to start implementing first?\n\nI can begin working on any of these components immediately once we decide on the approach.\n</ask>\n</function_calls>', 'tool_calls': None}
